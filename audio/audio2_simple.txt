[0.00s -> 3.84s]  including our submitters. Thank you very much for taking your time to be with us today.
[5.20s -> 9.68s]  We're obviously not re-adjoining because that's not the right word, but we're coming together
[9.68s -> 13.68s]  after our German-eased-ad afternoon having heard from a handful of submitters and we'll listen to
[13.68s -> 19.20s]  our final three today, but I will pass over to Greg Pollard just to do a brief introduction and
[19.20s -> 26.24s]  then we'll move on. Thank you, Greg. Okay, thank you, Chair. Yes, we're reconvening and continuing
[26.24s -> 38.64s]  with the hearings of submissions on the annual plan 2021. We have three presentations this morning.
[39.52s -> 48.40s]  These are all concerned with community funding. We're beginning with Harriet Dixon and Robin Parker
[48.40s -> 55.68s]  from the Cambridge Community House Trust. It seems that there's been a concerted effort by the
[55.68s -> 64.72s]  trust board to make sure that you're fully aware of services that they provide and to put
[64.72s -> 71.76s]  their requests in front of you. So as you've seen there be the number of submissions from the
[71.76s -> 78.96s]  board and the supporting organisations, we've got Julie Epps, who many of you will
[79.92s -> 87.52s]  will know from the Cambridge Committee of Social Services and Ray Miller from
[88.56s -> 95.36s]  Santander's Presbyterian Church in T.O.A.A. Motu. There's a three submissions you'll be hearing
[95.36s -> 101.44s]  from today and then we'll be moving into deliberations. Okay, thank you, Chair.
[101.44s -> 110.64s]  Chair, may I interrupt you for a moment, sorry. Yes, yesterday, I believe that even though we are
[110.64s -> 119.36s]  not, we're not hearing a submission from the Cambridge Museum Trust and the Cambridge Heritage
[119.36s -> 126.80s]  Society, both which are linked to the museum that I should have expressed a conflict of interest
[126.88s -> 133.44s]  with one of the submissions, which although we're not hearing from, is still within the overall
[133.44s -> 139.36s]  annual plans of missions. So I'd like to register that conflict of interest now, if I may.
[139.92s -> 144.96s]  Yeah, I think thank you for that Roger. I was going to raise it before we into deliberations
[145.60s -> 151.04s]  but thank you for raising it now. If we could actually through the cheer also, can I just
[151.04s -> 158.40s]  say Sam is Roger? I'm not directly linked to him. I still do cheer. I'm sorry for trust and
[158.40s -> 163.52s]  bored us, so I'm saying for myself, thank you. Okay, thank you. Thanks for that, Mike, and I take
[163.52s -> 168.40s]  it we can night those. Thank you, Jenny. I was going to raise it before we as I say we into deliberations
[168.40s -> 173.76s]  but now it's good at time as any. Thanks very much. Now, as Graham mentioned, we have heard
[173.76s -> 178.40s]  it with us. So, Harrod, if you'd like to commence your submission, I would love to thank you.
[178.88s -> 185.44s]  Thanks. Really lovely to see you all. I think I've met most of you possibly over the last 18
[185.44s -> 189.92s]  months as I've been general manager of Cambridge Community House. I think most of you know the
[189.92s -> 195.84s]  organization within Cambridge has been running since 1985 and has the main service in Cambridge
[195.84s -> 203.52s]  providing family and social services for the area. We've been really creating a hub for anybody who
[203.52s -> 209.20s]  can come in, even off the street, we take walk-ins who are in need, so people can come to the house
[209.20s -> 214.64s]  of support. There's no judgment here and really we just provide that full wrap around service for people.
[214.64s -> 220.88s]  So, our aim is to walk alongside people and families to make sure that they meet their goals
[220.88s -> 225.44s]  and enable them to get back in control of their lives. And we provide many services here.
[225.44s -> 231.76s]  I'm sure you're aware. We have my submission to outline all the different services that we provide
[231.76s -> 236.96s]  for free for families of Cambridge. Something that I probably didn't mention is that we work with a
[236.96s -> 244.72s]  lot of homeless people. Even during lockdown, I had a couple of one couple and one older gentleman who
[244.72s -> 249.92s]  was a homeless during this time, one living in a tent and one just looking on the one part bench.
[249.92s -> 253.44s]  So, you know, those are the types of things that we're helping with in Cambridge too,
[253.44s -> 256.80s]  to make sure that there aren't people sleeping on the streets of Cambridge. We don't have
[256.80s -> 261.36s]  a homeless problem because we're helping those people. And we just wrap ourselves around them
[261.36s -> 265.68s]  and make sure that we can enable them to get the support that they need through work and income.
[265.68s -> 271.28s]  We get them into short-term emergency accommodation, which is the difficult in Cambridge,
[271.28s -> 276.40s]  but we try our best to get them into that short-term accommodation and then into that long-term
[276.40s -> 282.24s]  accommodation to make sure they've got that security over the long-term, which is what they need.
[282.24s -> 285.92s]  And they need that support because quite often they're just faced with a totally overwhelming
[285.92s -> 290.08s]  situation. And they're quite often at risk as well as through a side and all the rest of it
[290.08s -> 294.72s]  because they just can't cope with what they're doing. I certainly feel really privileged to
[294.72s -> 300.32s]  be in the position that I am, the head of the house here, you know, to implement the services that we
[300.32s -> 306.32s]  provide. It's great for me to be able to do this and just speak for our community to you guys
[306.32s -> 312.00s]  today just to say that there are many families in need in Cambridge. We're helping 42 families
[312.00s -> 316.48s]  a week at the moment with food and that's a surprise to many people that there are that many
[316.48s -> 320.88s]  people in need. And that's growing on a daily basis at the moment. And with COVID-19,
[320.88s -> 326.80s]  we've just had we're expecting an explosion of people who are facing redundancy and also their
[326.80s -> 332.00s]  own businesses going under. People who have not been in a financially unstable position before
[332.00s -> 336.32s]  and don't know where to seek help. And so we're making sure that we're putting ourselves out into
[336.32s -> 340.80s]  the community so that nobody knows that they can come to us for that support and help to get back
[340.80s -> 346.00s]  on their feet. And it's about enabling people and not here to be a creature of people to lean on
[346.00s -> 350.80s]  forever. That's not the idea. The idea is that they come to us and that we support them and that we
[350.80s -> 355.44s]  walk alongside them and enable them to take control of their financial situation and get back
[355.44s -> 361.60s]  on their feet. It's about breaking down that overwhelm, reducing the risk of the suicide for them
[361.60s -> 367.44s]  and being able to get them back on their feet in a way that they want to demand for our services
[367.44s -> 372.88s]  has just exploded over the last four years. It is doubled and yet offending hasn't. And so we
[372.88s -> 379.84s]  are struggling to each year to be able to maintain our services. We've had a loss for the last two
[379.84s -> 383.60s]  years running this year with managed to turn that around slightly and I feel like we're going
[383.60s -> 389.20s]  to be a bit more than even keel. But with COVID-19 coming along I am worried to be honest with you
[389.20s -> 394.40s]  about funding going forward. A lot of our regular funders at the moment are not funding anybody
[394.40s -> 399.20s]  and we've had lots of conversations over the last couple of months with my regular funders who have
[399.20s -> 405.44s]  got really good relationships with. And they're just they've closed their books, they're not
[405.44s -> 410.08s]  taking anybody on for funding at the moment. And that includes our local organisations like the
[410.08s -> 415.36s]  rotary and lions who have been great supporters of us. And they're just so wonderful people but
[415.36s -> 419.28s]  they don't have the income coming in and so they can't give them money out. And that's the story
[419.28s -> 425.68s]  across quite a lot of the usual funders that we talked to. And so yeah so we're certainly seeing
[425.68s -> 433.44s]  the need, the growth is there and we are looking next year at potentially an issue with funding
[433.44s -> 438.32s]  for our organisation. And we want to continue to provide these services. I really see Cambridge
[438.32s -> 443.60s]  community health as one of the biggest players in the recovery from COVID-19 for Cambridge
[443.60s -> 448.96s]  and across the Whiter region as well. You know we are that place where people can come to like I said
[448.96s -> 453.76s]  to support to be able to enable people to get back on their feet back into work. You know we support
[453.76s -> 459.28s]  people with that as well. We really will take anybody's needs into account or based upon what
[459.28s -> 466.32s]  those families needs are. And we will reach out to other organisations if we don't do what we are
[467.52s -> 471.92s]  the services ourselves and we reach out to other organisations to provide the support and
[471.92s -> 478.80s]  the benefit that they need. I'd like to just pass over to Robin. I've got Caroline Casey and Robin
[478.80s -> 484.72s]  Parker with us today who are long-term board members of Cambridge Community House and really
[484.72s -> 491.04s]  strong supporters of what we do. Caroline Casey is our chair and Robin Parker who has kind of
[491.04s -> 495.52s]  the trustees for a long time now. But Robin has got a few things that she would like to say
[495.52s -> 498.24s]  as well I think that it would be valid to hear from her now.
[498.48s -> 505.28s]  Robin, do you want to unmute your microphone and talk?
[508.96s -> 514.16s]  I think yep, there she comes.
[514.16s -> 525.12s]  I'm going back as better. Let's say it's going back on to me.
[525.12s -> 530.16s]  Can you hear me?
[530.16s -> 532.16s]  Can you hear me?
[532.16s -> 534.16s]  Yes.
[534.16s -> 538.16s]  Okay.
[538.16s -> 547.12s]  Oh, good morning. My name is Robin Parker and Caroline Casey. I just would like to add to
[547.12s -> 550.88s]  on a different angle.
[550.88s -> 559.76s]  I'm just my submission itself is really focusing on a capital grant of $50,000 which is our shortfall
[559.84s -> 570.80s]  for our expansion to our building which we need. I would just would like to raise the point that
[570.80s -> 577.12s]  we're on land that's just type of community purposes and you would all know
[577.12s -> 581.92s]  like that district council's purposes to partner with the community and promoting the
[582.00s -> 590.56s]  well-being of its people and the empowerment of community whilst providing opportunity equally
[590.56s -> 600.88s]  and with an efficient service and so I would just would like to cancel to
[601.20s -> 616.88s]  close and the resting grounding, planting, applying in the past.
[620.08s -> 621.84s]  I think I touched. I think I touched.
[621.84s -> 623.84s]  I think I touched. I think I touched.
[623.84s -> 625.84s]  I think I touched.
[625.84s -> 627.84s]  I think I touched.
[627.84s -> 639.84s]  Is it just me or is everybody experiencing problems and hearing?
[639.84s -> 643.84s]  Robert. Okay. That's me. Robin's condition.
[643.84s -> 645.84s]  Who do you want?
[645.84s -> 647.84s]  Sorry.
[647.84s -> 649.84s]  By what?
[649.84s -> 653.84s]  Turn your video off because it would help with the streaming because you're bandwidth as low.
[653.84s -> 655.84s]  Nick, Nick was off-rooted.
[657.84s -> 661.84s]  I'm out of the country.
[663.84s -> 669.20s]  I think Robin's trying to talk to the fact that we are building an extension at the moment to the
[669.20s -> 674.64s]  community house and this has been building now since February and it's going great guns and
[674.64s -> 678.08s]  actually got the frames up and we're looking like we're going to have a really good house
[678.08s -> 682.72s]  come September. This has been needed because at the moment we're working at a pebbins on site
[682.72s -> 688.24s]  which are not great because they're cold in winter and they're hot in summer and so yeah so
[688.24s -> 693.20s]  we're doing that at the moment and we're really lucky to have the land rented from council.
[693.20s -> 696.24s]  It's absolutely amazing to have this position in town.
[696.24s -> 698.72s]  People know where they are. They know where to come to.
[698.72s -> 704.40s]  That's wonderful from that point of view and yeah we are looking for funding to pick off the project.
[704.40s -> 710.56s]  The feminine fortunate setback where we have next to $50,000 added on to the post which is like 10%
[710.56s -> 714.80s]  of the build cost which is huge for us and we just don't have funding for it.
[714.80s -> 720.64s]  That was due to the some of the firewall regulations due to being an external boundary around the house
[720.64s -> 725.60s]  or even though it's on council land so we've had to adjust the plans for that which is fine but
[725.60s -> 731.04s]  it's it's thought about an additional cost. I think we were hoping that being council land
[731.04s -> 735.12s]  and always going to be a council building because it's on your land. There's no chance of
[735.12s -> 739.36s]  moving this building. It has now had complete footings put in around the firewall so there's no
[739.36s -> 744.24s]  chance of moving out of the land that it'll always be a community building. I'm hoping
[744.24s -> 749.84s]  it'll always be the community house but certainly it will always be a building for the community
[749.84s -> 754.56s]  and to use and having the expansion there means that we can also bring you know that we'll
[754.56s -> 758.00s]  have space for our services which are expanding which is great but we'll also have additional
[758.00s -> 762.64s]  runs for other community groups to come and use. The women's refuge of oil already expressed an
[762.64s -> 768.32s]  interest in wanting to use one of our runs to talk to women who are in crisis.
[768.56s -> 773.36s]  No, no, no other organisations as well who currently don't have a presence in Cambridge because
[773.36s -> 777.36s]  they don't have a space fee and we're certainly really interested in collaborating with them
[777.36s -> 782.00s]  to bring those services to Cambridge on a more permanent basis and a more regular basis by having
[782.00s -> 787.28s]  them in the community house alongside us so yeah certainly looking forward to having that building
[787.28s -> 792.48s]  space finished but yes, unfortunately we are a bit short on the funding side.
[793.44s -> 798.72s]  Okay, so we're not being able to talk now or you're still having problems.
[801.76s -> 803.36s]  I think she's still having issues.
[803.36s -> 810.80s]  Okay, I think we can't meet her.
[812.00s -> 819.36s]  I think I mean let's all right Robin look I think Harriet's covered it off pretty squeal in
[819.44s -> 822.08s]  your submissions pretty clear tone and and respect of that.
[822.88s -> 828.00s]  Request for 50,000 so thank you for that. Now I just need to ask are there any questions
[828.00s -> 832.00s]  of Harriet or even Robin if we're able to connect with you but I think that might be a bit
[832.00s -> 836.40s]  dodgy right now. Jim, can you hear me?
[837.36s -> 840.56s]  It's just I think that's cutting in and out Robin.
[840.56s -> 852.40s]  Okay, sorry. Am I able to present a Russian question later in the day?
[852.40s -> 858.56s]  I was just wondering, I'll see what I could do here.
[859.52s -> 862.72s]  And the meantime, Jim, have your question for Eric?
[862.72s -> 870.64s]  Yeah thanks, isn't Harriet, thanks for all the work that you're doing and look it's not really a
[870.64s -> 876.00s]  question it's just in terms of Council's point of view. I know the facilities that you're working
[876.00s -> 885.44s]  out of and absolutely you need the additional additional space and and look it's a huge task that
[885.44s -> 891.12s]  you've got an unfortunately growing with with the COVID situations. I look I totally support
[891.12s -> 899.92s]  what you're doing and look from a Cambridge perspective in the wider district we're really
[899.92s -> 906.32s]  short on social services central government seem to just run a blanket rule or over the whole
[906.32s -> 912.32s]  wipe out district and say we've got to load social deprivation index therefore we don't need any help.
[912.40s -> 916.88s]  So the only way we're going to do this is if Council gets in behind you so look thanks for all
[916.88s -> 923.76s]  you work and we'll consider this along with everything else. Yeah thanks. Thanks Jim.
[923.76s -> 930.48s]  Roger to do the question or comment. Yeah I have a question but first of all I'd just like to
[930.48s -> 935.04s]  support the work that you do you're actually on the ground there and you're making a difference
[935.04s -> 940.80s]  in Cambridge. So thank you very much for the services that you provide to our community.
[941.52s -> 946.80s]  You mentioned that some of your traditional funding sources had actually dried up on my
[946.80s -> 952.08s]  member of Rotary so I know that we're just not having major funding projects.
[952.88s -> 959.76s]  Give us an indication of your operational funding from those sources. How much are you missing out on
[959.76s -> 965.68s]  this? Yeah we would have expected race to race funds the events that was planned for March.
[966.64s -> 970.80s]  All right for one of it was to race around $20,000 for us.
[972.00s -> 977.36s]  Lions you would have expected probably another $5 to $10,000 from those guys now and then from
[978.48s -> 983.84s]  maybe as like pub charity and other organisations like that probably another $20,000 by now to be on this
[983.84s -> 990.24s]  video. So all of it probably about $60,000 sure to do. Yeah that's mostly operational funding.
[990.24s -> 998.80s]  Yeah absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Roger. Now does anybody have another question clear?
[998.80s -> 1005.36s]  So yeah thanks and look Harriet I'm really impressed with what you've achieved and yet
[1005.36s -> 1011.36s]  had solved all your team here for the work that you do there on Cambridge. I mean the question I
[1011.36s -> 1017.12s]  had is as understanding more about why you're not getting that extra support from central government
[1017.12s -> 1021.92s]  because you know I hear the messaging you know that they want to make sure that people are
[1021.92s -> 1027.76s]  supported through this but you know your story is that they're not doing it. So what's your experience
[1027.76s -> 1033.76s]  with you know the reception you're getting from central government? Yeah it's it's it's a lot of
[1033.76s -> 1038.64s]  great talk and I'm quite disappointed really you know the the money that they were putting into mental
[1038.64s -> 1044.56s]  health not seen not seen a centre that really haven't and it's so disappointing it really is because
[1044.56s -> 1050.16s]  like we are at the coal phase we are making really good differences to people live. We're stopping
[1050.16s -> 1055.92s]  so aside we're making people more functional and better members of society you know through
[1055.92s -> 1060.32s]  through the addiction service and yet we're not seeing an increase in any of the funding for that.
[1060.32s -> 1067.28s]  They are talking about an increase in in the family violence sector but I feel that that is
[1067.28s -> 1071.92s]  really much a sort of ambulance at the bottom of the cliff scenario and yet they're about to
[1071.92s -> 1078.40s]  take away our funding at the end of December for our proactive violence free wipe or work which
[1078.40s -> 1083.52s]  is where we actually educate in schools as well with programs like loves me not on healthy relationships
[1083.52s -> 1088.00s]  how to spot abuse and it's not just we're not talking just physical abuse here we're talking
[1088.00s -> 1092.48s]  about financial abuse, verbal abuse you know that emotional abuse everything that takes a toll on
[1092.48s -> 1097.68s]  on a person and and ruin who they are and and makes them unable to function in life and you know
[1097.68s -> 1102.48s]  those are those sort of things that should be funded and it looks like it's going to stop in December
[1102.48s -> 1105.68s]  and then that's that's all I've heard so far and that it's not going to be any funding for it.
[1106.40s -> 1110.72s]  Other things like financial mentoring service there's murmurings at the moment that they
[1110.72s -> 1114.80s]  might be some extra money put into it whether that reaches Cambridge is another thing because
[1114.80s -> 1120.40s]  it's nationwide. I have to say in this region we are a little bit thought of as you know we've got
[1120.40s -> 1125.68s]  enough money in our community to support what we're doing and we don't need government support and yet
[1125.76s -> 1130.96s]  I don't see is that you know I see a community just like any other with with extreme needs just
[1130.96s -> 1135.52s]  like any other it's just unfortunate that you know we've got a wonderful image which is great for
[1135.52s -> 1140.16s]  the town don't get me wrong but for funding perspective I kind of get up against that a lot with
[1140.16s -> 1143.60s]  barriers you know facing the fact that people think we're an athlete's town.
[1146.24s -> 1147.52s]  Mark I suggest a question here.
[1148.80s -> 1155.12s]  I've got a couple of questions and first off do you do combine work with Kanga I had to
[1155.12s -> 1159.76s]  share resources amongst white power with Tiamu and Cambridge communities?
[1159.76s -> 1164.24s]  Yes absolutely yes we do we work really closely with Kanga and his team over there yes we do we
[1164.24s -> 1168.72s]  have regular meetings because it's really important our community should have the choices
[1168.72s -> 1173.20s]  well whether they work in one community and live in another they should have the choice of where they
[1173.20s -> 1177.60s]  where they go and seek help from you know what's most convenient for them so yes absolutely yeah
[1177.60s -> 1181.52s]  we're working really closely with all of the social services in across the White region even
[1181.52s -> 1186.24s]  neutral how that as well we're closely with Deb and her team over there yeah and my second question
[1186.24s -> 1191.28s]  is and do you get support from Council at all flight from their community boards or would you
[1191.28s -> 1194.96s]  prefer to get me to the support from the community boards so in same with I know you can't
[1194.96s -> 1201.68s]  speak on behalf of Kanga and Tiamu do but would that help and go some way to the community boards
[1201.68s -> 1206.32s]  we were really greatly received $1,000 from Cambridge Community Board last year towards our
[1206.32s -> 1211.92s]  build and 2000 from the Tiamu to community board as well and I've just made an application
[1211.92s -> 1217.60s]  on today for help with the violence free wiper work because funding for that is going to see so
[1217.60s -> 1222.16s]  yeah I definitely applying to those guys and that and that group of people regularly as well yes
[1224.16s -> 1226.96s]  all right so but what about for
[1226.96s -> 1232.88s]  I'm ready for the operating expenses for your businesses like if you've got a regular
[1232.88s -> 1237.28s]  amount from our community boards would that go some way than helping you in the future?
[1237.28s -> 1241.92s]  I don't mind where the funding comes from I really don't mind where the funding comes from
[1241.92s -> 1246.48s]  if we get the funding from our you know the community board or from the Council is wonderful yeah
[1248.72s -> 1252.32s]  regular funding yeah regular funding that we can count on that's that's the problem
[1254.32s -> 1257.44s]  okay thanks thank you Marcus thank you Harriet I'm Liz I think you got to hand up the
[1258.08s -> 1262.48s]  yeah yeah and I thanks hey I'm Harriet obviously yeah we're going to have a little while now
[1262.48s -> 1268.48s]  but just want to say you know you guys are really well organised and and well connected with
[1268.48s -> 1272.80s]  our community and I think your expansion is a signal just how organised you are and how
[1272.80s -> 1278.24s]  and for me it sure you are and how far you've got one of the things I guess I'm interested in
[1278.24s -> 1284.96s]  as around social housing and your thoughts on that while we have councillors all in one place
[1285.68s -> 1290.16s]  I'm aware and you're aware that there's some pension housing units going up right beside you
[1290.72s -> 1294.72s]  but I'm interested in in your views on the social issues and whether there's more that we can be
[1294.72s -> 1299.84s]  doing to help you with emergency housing that's all yeah yeah I didn't know whether to bring that up
[1299.84s -> 1304.16s]  today or not it wasn't part of my submission because operation funding and the building fund is
[1304.16s -> 1308.72s]  is critical for us right now but yes you're absolutely right there is no emergency housing
[1308.72s -> 1314.56s]  in Cambridge it's incredibly hard to to get any short term you know emergency housing for anybody
[1314.56s -> 1320.00s]  I think I looked at I looked in during the COVID-19 because places didn't have anybody staying
[1320.00s -> 1323.76s]  with them so they're actually keen for the income so we managed to get like I said the
[1323.76s -> 1328.24s]  couple of the hundreds of people we were working with into that short term accommodation
[1328.24s -> 1332.48s]  and now they've got into long term accommodation but that's through private rentals they they've
[1332.48s -> 1337.60s]  not been able to to get any sort of social housing you know the the list for that is long
[1337.60s -> 1342.40s]  and the number of houses is short I worked really closely with Brian that has in New Zealand
[1342.40s -> 1348.08s]  and yeah he talks to him he says that the turnover is just incredibly low in Cambridge we don't
[1348.08s -> 1354.64s]  have people moving out of social housing and I think other areas do people tend to stay put
[1355.04s -> 1359.44s]  in Cambridge and I can't blame them it's a lot of people face to live and yeah you know I think
[1360.40s -> 1366.32s]  more housing stock being able to have you know some housing that maybe I mean you've
[1366.32s -> 1371.28s]  and I've talked about it before some housing that maybe we could oversee the rental off so that
[1371.28s -> 1377.20s]  we could put families into even short term whilst we then find them long term private accommodation
[1377.20s -> 1381.84s]  here all those things that I'd be happy to talk about and just discuss with council as
[1381.84s -> 1386.48s]  to yeah how we can solve this problem long term because we are going to end up with people
[1387.04s -> 1390.64s]  living on the streets I mean yeah in their cars that's what people come to us all the time
[1390.96s -> 1395.20s]  in the cars and you know that's no way to lift people as it is chronic is a chronic
[1395.20s -> 1400.40s]  situation and it brings about mental health issues it brings about physical illnesses and you
[1400.40s -> 1406.16s]  know that's no way for people it actually puts more pressure on our health services and the hospital
[1406.16s -> 1411.20s]  is on term and it does to actually you know yep that in the budget and get people into homes
[1411.20s -> 1419.20s]  and you're healthy yeah thanks for that Harriet I Roger to do you have one last coming to make
[1419.28s -> 1426.16s]  yeah oh thank you well it's a question Harriet it seems to me that you've got a 50,000 short
[1426.16s -> 1434.56s]  fall on your operational funding and a 50,000 short fall on your building costs if there's a
[1434.56s -> 1443.68s]  limited pot of money which comes first in your priority I think right now no no you're absolutely
[1443.68s -> 1447.36s]  right and I think right now we have to get that building done we absolutely have to get that building
[1447.36s -> 1451.04s]  finished it's due to be finished in September the builders that we're working with are really
[1451.04s -> 1456.96s]  keen to get on with it they've made fantastic progress even with the you know the seven weeks that
[1456.96s -> 1461.92s]  we've we've lost through COVID-19 they've actually made up time over the last couple of weeks
[1461.92s -> 1465.04s]  it's absolutely amazing the progress that they're making there and he's a really
[1465.84s -> 1470.48s]  socially conscious guy as well here the builder who are working with Kit Markin just joining
[1470.48s -> 1476.08s]  to Kit Markin and so he's really helping us and he's kept that cost down he's donated I think $8,000
[1476.08s -> 1481.52s]  worth of his time and his team's time over over this period to to find a solution to that
[1481.52s -> 1485.84s]  problem that we came across but but the outcome from there is a 51,000 dollar bill
[1486.40s -> 1490.40s]  that we need to cover the cost of yeah and I would really like to see that done so that we can
[1490.40s -> 1495.76s]  actually move forward and have the space to expand our services into I think that that's actually
[1495.76s -> 1502.48s]  power mount right now thank you thank you Harriet for that clarification look um I think I
[1502.48s -> 1507.12s]  speak for everybody here when I say we're really at my year in your organisation I think you
[1507.12s -> 1512.96s]  enormously for the work you do it is often thankless and and obviously reasonably unsupported
[1512.96s -> 1517.20s]  financially but certainly it's it's much appreciated you know giving the voice and it's
[1517.20s -> 1522.48s]  support to people to marginalise your own systems so thank you for that and we're kind of we have
[1522.48s -> 1527.76s]  a little over time but I think we are all appreciated your comments on social housing issues so thank you
[1528.64s -> 1534.96s]  wonderful thanks very much and I think we move now on then to our next submitter which is
[1534.96s -> 1538.64s]  Julie Epps from the Cambridge Committee of Social Services and I'm sure she doesn't mean
[1539.20s -> 1546.80s]  mine been slightly late on account of Harriet's issues to raise with us so welcome Julie and please
[1546.80s -> 1555.36s]  take away hi it's lovely to be here and to see everybody lockdown seems to have been a long time
[1555.36s -> 1561.84s]  and it's nice to see people's faces so thank you for this opportunity today um to speak to
[1561.84s -> 1568.96s]  this submission um so I'm here on behalf of Cambridge's social services committee to support the
[1568.96s -> 1576.32s]  community houses submission so these three things I wanted to add and I'm on top of what we put into
[1576.32s -> 1582.72s]  our written submission um the first one is what is something I noticed which was the was a large number
[1582.72s -> 1588.80s]  of other submitters who have also written in support of the community house and I mean that's
[1588.80s -> 1596.72s]  great that shows that there is this support for this wonderful organisation um we we wrote submission
[1597.28s -> 1604.16s]  because we all know how important the community house is for the people of Cambridge from from the
[1604.16s -> 1610.24s]  experience of our committee we've worked with Harriet and her team and we know how her they work
[1610.88s -> 1617.28s]  providing the reference services for our town they're good at what they do and they get things done
[1618.56s -> 1624.80s]  my second point is that the community house is a real hub for the community so people can go
[1624.80s -> 1630.40s]  the it's non-judge mental they can they can walk in the door they receive these services it's a
[1630.40s -> 1636.08s]  real hub we're lucky to have it and we need this hub to be strong for for our community
[1637.04s -> 1644.48s]  as a hub they're also very inclusive of other social services groups or our organisations
[1644.48s -> 1650.48s]  where as a as a committee of the social services we're able to use the the meeting room for our
[1650.48s -> 1661.84s]  meeting and other groups as well so it is a real hub the third my third point is with COVID-19 it
[1661.84s -> 1668.48s]  really hits home how important the community house is to our community what what we've observed
[1668.48s -> 1676.24s]  is the community house of Povertyal they were Povertyal during COVID so on the front line
[1676.24s -> 1681.68s]  providing assistance to those in need they did a huge amount of work and a lot of it would have
[1681.68s -> 1690.48s]  been unseen um doing food parcels providing household items organising emergency accommodation for
[1690.48s -> 1698.88s]  people and all on top of the normal services doing the counselling education family violence supports
[1698.88s -> 1704.00s]  the the money mentoring it's all so important and it all had to go on um although they did it
[1704.00s -> 1710.40s]  out of the office they're home officers and veterans and in lounges they worked them with other
[1710.40s -> 1717.68s]  organisations during COVID so the South Asian Army Food Bank, Coibolution Food Together the Cambridge
[1717.76s -> 1723.60s]  Lions who who set up their food Caribbean with hot food is which is just amazing for our community
[1724.48s -> 1729.60s]  also we can receive all defence and and I know that they reached out on social media
[1730.88s -> 1738.40s]  to the our community who who also donated lots of stuff that was needed and as it was
[1738.40s -> 1744.40s]  needed so we've got a lot to be proud of um they were really busy I'm not sure we're not when
[1744.40s -> 1753.36s]  Harriet found any time to sleep so um what the predicted hardship from Coibage um social services
[1753.36s -> 1758.16s]  and the community houses social services they provide they're going to be in hard amount now
[1759.04s -> 1764.24s]  and it's got personal we all know of people who've already lost their jobs due to COVID
[1764.24s -> 1770.08s]  and it's affecting each and every one of us um it's could be someone in our family a friend
[1770.08s -> 1777.12s]  a neighbour it's affecting everyone these hardships are going to create extra pressures and families
[1777.12s -> 1783.76s]  we're it's financial emotional social and without help for these families there's also the
[1783.76s -> 1790.08s]  potential for adverse flow on effects in our community if behaviours below the um into the wider
[1790.08s -> 1795.68s]  community people are going to need help getting back on their feet and the community houses
[1795.68s -> 1801.12s]  vital for it I think Harriet's got one of the toughest jobs in the town and it just got tougher
[1802.56s -> 1807.76s]  so in summary from the social services committee what we're asking council to consider
[1807.76s -> 1815.36s]  is to help resource a community house to succeed help them to do the job of helping others
[1815.36s -> 1822.64s]  for the benefit of the individuals their families and for all our community so thank you for your time today
[1825.68s -> 1831.20s]  thank you very much Julie that that was a really um well presented submission really appreciate it
[1831.20s -> 1839.60s]  can I call for any questions or comments of Julie Hazel yes um thanks Susan and Harriet
[1839.60s -> 1846.64s]  lovely to meet you and I've been listening intently to um what you've had to say and the same for
[1846.96s -> 1856.64s]  Robin what background have you got what professional background have you got that actually um we know
[1856.64s -> 1862.64s]  that this is safe and guidance that's giving to everybody and where is the point what do you do
[1862.64s -> 1869.12s]  at a point when you think hey this is not for us this needs to go to a particular service and do you
[1869.12s -> 1876.32s]  refer on and I'm getting this to some some other positions that that you know that we work in
[1876.32s -> 1885.20s]  I so yes that's that's where I'd like to know a bit more of that out of it all of our team
[1885.20s -> 1891.04s]  uh sorry Hazel all of our team are are really well trained um the fact that we have a free service
[1891.04s -> 1896.88s]  doesn't mean that we have people who are just volunteers and not well do have some volunteers
[1896.88s -> 1900.64s]  obviously but doesn't mean they're not qualified doesn't mean that they're not um parts
[1900.64s -> 1906.08s]  uh members of um bodies that mean that their uh workers is scrutinized and and they had super
[1906.08s -> 1910.72s]  peer supervision as well to make sure that their workers tip top so we have our councillors who
[1910.72s -> 1916.56s]  are members of the New Zealand counselling association they all members of that um we have our
[1916.56s -> 1922.24s]  alcohol and drug councillor who's a department registered um member and to be members of those
[1922.24s -> 1927.44s]  organisations yeah your work is scrutinized and you have to be a tip top um you know in your
[1927.44s -> 1934.56s]  profession and they are all really well professionally um well um well trained uh and they have
[1934.56s -> 1938.08s]  ongoing training as well and that's another additional cost for us as well we have their membership
[1938.08s -> 1941.84s]  cost each year and we have their training cost each year there which you know they continue to
[1941.84s -> 1948.16s]  do special they keep up with the latest therapies latest trends etc in care for people
[1948.24s -> 1954.16s]  our financial mentors go through a rigorous uh set of training which is um over seven weeks
[1954.16s -> 1961.60s]  and they uh get a through the fincap organisation which is funded by uh MSD Ministry of Social Development
[1961.60s -> 1966.00s]  and uh yeah financial cases is fincap and uh yeah they have rigorous training again and they also
[1966.00s -> 1970.80s]  have supervision before they're allowed to see clients by themselves and they have ongoing um
[1970.80s -> 1975.44s]  peer supervision so we have a team leader who is extremely experienced in financial
[1976.32s -> 1981.12s]  years and obviously herself has gone through the training and still goes on regular training courses
[1981.12s -> 1987.04s]  and she oversees what they do as a step-by-step basis we have our own policies and procedures
[1987.04s -> 1991.84s]  which make sure that we are kept safe and also that our clients are kept safe we're all police
[1991.84s -> 1996.72s]  fetids and even volunteers within our organisation are police fetids actually everybody's kept safe
[1996.72s -> 2002.56s]  and and that you know each other is safe um yeah just we're we're all really well um well trained
[2003.44s -> 2007.60s]  yeah it's just because it's a free service it's it's yeah I think a lot of people
[2007.60s -> 2011.84s]  probably have that perception that it's a free service so therefore people just you know maybe give
[2011.84s -> 2016.88s]  their time and they're not well qualified but are to have for to have the work that we do yeah
[2016.88s -> 2021.20s]  everybody has to be really well well qualified and have that supervision like I said and then
[2021.20s -> 2026.64s]  checking to make sure that they're working with talk yep that's great thank you for that clarification
[2026.72s -> 2037.92s]  Harriet you think does anybody else have any questions for Julie at all at least yes hi Julie
[2037.92s -> 2042.72s]  hey um one of the things I guess um that that may maybe some of the other councillors don't know
[2042.72s -> 2047.12s]  but when I started to teach in your meetings I was really surprised at the number of different
[2047.12s -> 2053.28s]  groups that you're connected with like the social services you know monthly meetings that you hold
[2053.36s -> 2057.44s]  actually connect a whole bunch of different community groups and Cambridge and I don't
[2057.44s -> 2062.88s]  probably have fully understand that can you and just give us a quick rundown of those groups
[2063.68s -> 2071.44s]  yep so so basically it is anybody who is involved in the social services so the community house
[2072.48s -> 2079.84s]  it's the Cambridge Food Bank which is run by the salvation army it's the
[2080.80s -> 2089.44s]  churches the individual churches it's the Cambridge Police one's women's refuge the citizen's
[2089.44s -> 2099.44s]  advice bureau age concern I'll probably missed a few the community board so it's
[2099.44s -> 2109.04s]  um you know work bridge we have we have a lot of members so it's really good and because
[2110.56s -> 2116.00s]  by coming together we can we can we can we know who we can talk to we can we can we can ask
[2116.00s -> 2122.88s]  questions at the meeting but we also can make those connections that help basically help the
[2122.88s -> 2130.48s]  community it's it's a great group and any councillors would be welcome to come along to you know
[2130.48s -> 2136.00s]  to the meetings at all if you're interested at all to see you know what we do or if you'd like
[2136.00s -> 2144.56s]  to see our our minutes you'd be welcome to as well yeah we meet monthly and it's basically
[2144.56s -> 2151.84s]  it's advocating helping supporting our social services and Cambridge. Wonderful thanks for that
[2151.84s -> 2158.40s]  clarification Jay a very broad and collective of people there obviously and produces results
[2158.40s -> 2164.24s]  Roger do you have a question? No just a final statement I think the comment is being that
[2164.96s -> 2172.00s]  the provision of social services is a a national central government issue at the point is if they
[2172.00s -> 2180.08s]  don't do it do we stand back and just let our community suffer because they're not doing it so I
[2180.40s -> 2188.32s]  really I think we need to look seriously. Thank you Roger thank you oh mate one last comment or
[2188.32s -> 2195.76s]  question from you. Yeah thanks for it Susan yeah I guess to start with the changing times and
[2195.76s -> 2200.56s]  a lot of businesses and organisations in this community put their money towards sort of
[2201.20s -> 2206.96s]  pick products or clubs next sort of thing and have done it traditionally but some of the ones
[2206.96s -> 2211.44s]  I mean thinking about have been thinking differently and rather than giving to some of the
[2211.44s -> 2215.52s]  organisations that have been given to in the past are thinking more of a social conscience so
[2215.52s -> 2221.60s]  it's just really good heritage to hear this in Robin maybe for some of us to go back some of these
[2221.60s -> 2225.84s]  people that are certain to think differently and this there'd be no better place in town
[2226.64s -> 2232.16s]  for these organisations or businesses to maybe come and and have a chat with you so I think probably
[2232.16s -> 2237.52s]  each of us know someone who we could we could go and get to knock on your door thank you.
[2237.52s -> 2242.56s]  Great thank you for that and I hope to feel like I'm hurrying everybody on but I'm just
[2242.56s -> 2248.88s]  mindful of our time constraints so thank you Harriet Robin and Julie all for your time and
[2248.88s -> 2254.48s]  commitment to to getting a submission or a number of submissions before us today and
[2254.48s -> 2260.96s]  respect of the Cambridge Community House and the Associated Services it's been a really
[2261.12s -> 2265.52s]  impressive to hear the work that you do and said also to say that we actually have such
[2265.52s -> 2269.76s]  need out there but but wonderful to know that there are great people such as yourselves out there
[2269.76s -> 2276.32s]  and rising to the occasion so many thanks and we'll just move on now to our final submitter for the day

[2281.04s -> 2289.36s]  Turn the Kyoto Qatar. Thank you for the opportunity to present in person and to welcome the
[2289.36s -> 2296.00s]  beltman planned on the Muzi Street by San Andrew's Church. It's a prying site on a
[2296.00s -> 2303.20s]  material route into the town centre and entrance way to the TMW Business Community.
[2303.68s -> 2311.04s]  This project is not about building a new church that is multifunctional and a community
[2311.04s -> 2319.20s]  focused complex with all rooms under one roof. Before starting to design this building we
[2319.20s -> 2326.72s]  met with some members of this council asking the questions what does TMW do lack in facilities
[2327.44s -> 2334.16s]  and what would you like us to incorporate in the new building? We believe that we have
[2334.16s -> 2342.56s]  listened and as a consequence in corporate as a civic counselling room and a larger room to
[2342.56s -> 2351.04s]  accommodate found out family counselling meetings. Also we have elected to build a category
[2351.04s -> 2358.48s]  three rated building, first strengthening community resilience by offering shelter and welfare
[2358.48s -> 2366.56s]  and the event of an emergency. The construction of the complex is expected to take approximately
[2366.56s -> 2375.36s]  10 months and offers employment opportunities to local people and businesses, first generating
[2375.36s -> 2383.84s]  an economic spinoff to our local community. The project is consented and spayed ready.
[2384.80s -> 2391.92s]  Local businesses will be involved in the project. The facilities will allow RTMV to be
[2391.92s -> 2399.92s]  proof-old as an effective place to visit and host a function or event generating an economic
[2399.92s -> 2406.72s]  benefit to local businesses and services bringing a positive impact on our community.
[2408.72s -> 2415.36s]  The new facility will offer much greater use by being multi-purpose be available seven days a
[2415.36s -> 2422.80s]  week and provide a commercial kitchen for both business hire and for use by community groups.
[2423.68s -> 2431.20s]  We have consulted with EU leaders and received positive support and encouragement from them.
[2433.04s -> 2439.04s]  We have a strong level of support for the project from our current community group users and others.
[2439.84s -> 2446.96s]  We see this project as a benefit to the wellbeing, vibrancy and connectedness of community
[2446.96s -> 2455.92s]  and community and the wider district. We have raised over $800,000 and your investment in
[2455.92s -> 2463.76s]  the multi-purpose and community-focused project will signal to other major funders,
[2463.76s -> 2472.72s]  York commitment and support of the project. We are Tena Coto, Tena Coto, Tena Coto,
[2472.72s -> 2480.88s]  Tena Coto. Thank you. Thank you very much, Ray. We have quite a significant project you've
[2480.88s -> 2488.48s]  got in the making there. We have any questions for Ray and respect of the Centantry's build.
[2489.92s -> 2493.76s]  All comments. Jim, you have your finger where I is there.
[2494.08s -> 2503.44s]  Thanks Susan. I'm not quite sure how to do that, but Ray, thank you for your submission.
[2503.44s -> 2512.08s]  I'm just really interested and I suppose in some ways I'm almost the reverse of impeccable timing
[2512.08s -> 2520.40s]  trying to get this built during the COVID pandemic that's raging. But 800,000 already raised,
[2521.28s -> 2528.56s]  what's the likelihood of getting the just assuming for arguments? A million was forth coming from
[2528.56s -> 2533.36s]  Council. They're still quite a shortfall. We've already heard this morning that a lot of the
[2533.36s -> 2541.52s]  funding agencies are just not investing at the moment. What's the likelihood that the balance
[2541.52s -> 2549.76s]  would be found? We've had very encouraging discussions with Trotswarketo and with the
[2550.40s -> 2556.80s]  lotteries board representative for the, well, what can I buy painting? One was just yesterday
[2556.80s -> 2565.20s]  when we had an update with them. And from that meeting, they're very interested to see what the
[2565.20s -> 2573.76s]  outcome of our proposal is with the local council. So they're our applications to them,
[2573.76s -> 2578.80s]  half a million each, and that will give us over the three million.
[2583.84s -> 2589.04s]  Jim, did you say something through the there? Oh, yeah, I'm just sorry, I'm muted, but I just
[2589.04s -> 2593.04s]  it thanks. Yeah. Okay, great. Look, I have a question here. Unfortunately,
[2593.04s -> 2597.68s]  Portal Davies are unable to, she's in technical issues as well. She's a eerie representative.
[2597.68s -> 2602.48s]  And she's a question for you, Ray. She asks, will bar facilities be provided?
[2603.44s -> 2609.76s]  No. No, okay. Great. I think that that clears that one up for her. Thank you for that.
[2609.76s -> 2611.52s]  Does anybody else have any questions?
[2615.60s -> 2617.36s]  Claire, you have your hand up there.
[2618.16s -> 2621.84s]  You think it's more of a comment, though. I just want to say Ray that, you know, I was really
[2621.84s -> 2629.28s]  well prepared for Portal. Obviously, putting a lot of work and checking what was needed in our community
[2629.36s -> 2636.32s]  and taking that multifunctional view and trying to make sure that what is built will actually
[2637.28s -> 2641.36s]  you're really left. I suppose the social well being and cultural well being, yeah, I'm about
[2641.36s -> 2648.48s]  eerie up. So I just wanted to say thanks to the team for putting in all of that sort of
[2648.48s -> 2652.72s]  groundwork to come up with this kind of proposal. Thanks. Thank you.
[2652.80s -> 2658.80s]  Right. Does anybody else have anything for Ray any further?
[2660.24s -> 2670.40s]  Cazel. Yeah, thanks. Ray, great to hear you again. You know that I have a great
[2670.40s -> 2680.64s]  interest in the social services and could you envisage your building as a meeting place for
[2680.64s -> 2686.72s]  the social services? Well, I think what we need into our mood to is a one connecting place
[2687.28s -> 2694.32s]  that we can. We've got our health and welfare committee, but it's a maybe it goes and
[2694.32s -> 2699.28s]  sometimes and maybe it doesn't. We want to something a bit more positive and I'd be looking
[2699.28s -> 2706.00s]  for that for quite some years now as to how we could actually pull all of our social services
[2706.00s -> 2712.08s]  together and and seeing from the same hem-sheet for the whole town and our surrounding districts.
[2713.60s -> 2719.28s]  Could you see that building as perhaps providing that so there would be a permanent
[2721.12s -> 2727.36s]  resident, someone permanent there from the social services who could take in all that information
[2727.92s -> 2735.76s]  and also give that service to TRL Mutu? Well, yes, we're open to discussion
[2736.64s -> 2742.48s]  Hazel, to have a mind and perhaps I need to talk to your further just so that
[2743.44s -> 2752.08s]  some idea of a space that you require and the timing also not so much in timing, but
[2752.96s -> 2765.60s]  the usage during the week. But we're open to ideas. Thank you. Thank you.
[2766.48s -> 2769.12s]  Okay, Mike, you have your hand up there and in Liz.
[2771.36s -> 2778.80s]  So, Ray is just picking up on Jim's coming is you're feeling that if the council was in a
[2778.80s -> 2783.84s]  position to give a sizeable amount, that the two trusts that you mentioned would
[2783.84s -> 2787.68s]  would come in with the $500,000 each, is that you're sort of feeling.
[2788.40s -> 2796.40s]  That's the feeling I have and I guess I'd go through the further extent, I'd be quite disappointed
[2796.40s -> 2803.44s]  if they didn't come out with a significant amount towards the project of the council's support here.
[2804.08s -> 2804.56s]  Thank you.
[2807.68s -> 2814.16s]  Hi, Ray. I'm presuming that the building we see behind you on the TV screen is the proposed building.
[2814.16s -> 2814.64s]  Is that right?
[2817.04s -> 2824.48s]  It's very impressive building. I guess this is a tough time. In terms of timing, it probably
[2824.48s -> 2829.28s]  kind of begun worse than you in some ways. I've been involved in a few of these projects and
[2829.28s -> 2835.12s]  all I can say and just want to lean to hand and say to you, don't give up. This is always a
[2835.12s -> 2840.40s]  long road. The founders, you're doing all the right things, taking each one, you know,
[2840.40s -> 2846.00s]  offers as you can and yeah, just don't give up. I think this particular facility will be a
[2846.00s -> 2850.64s]  huge asset to our emergency. It's much needed and a great location for it as well.
[2851.92s -> 2857.60s]  Don't hesitate to reach out to us when you do hit those sort of slumps because it can be
[2857.60s -> 2866.24s]  tough going, that's for sure. Thank you. Thank you, Liz. Why is words? Has anybody
[2866.24s -> 2872.40s]  asked any questions or comments for Ray and a speech of his project? No, it looks like we're all
[2873.28s -> 2879.12s]  all questioned out. Thank you very much, Ray, for your time and for the if it sets your
[2879.12s -> 2884.80s]  and parish has pulled together and trying to establish a pretty impressive facility in
[2884.80s -> 2891.20s]  your motto is as much and it's not easy, but you're obviously a bunch of good minds
[2891.20s -> 2895.84s]  there and you've got a pretty impressive project and the work. Thank you very much, Mr. Black.
[2896.24s -> 2902.00s]  Yeah, thank you very much. Thank you. Right. Now, you're welcome to stay, but if you like,
[2902.00s -> 2908.24s]  you can go off on your merry way as with the other submitters. We now move, I believe,
[2908.24s -> 2916.24s]  until the deliberations phase of today's hearings, just a couple of housekeeping matters.
[2916.24s -> 2921.20s]  I don't know if the grain wanted to tidy them off or whether I should, but firstly, we'll
[2921.20s -> 2926.80s]  revisit the issues of potential conflicts of interest, which I think we've tidied away
[2926.80s -> 2932.80s]  Roger and Mike, here it's one at the beginning of this session, but it's in relation to any
[2932.80s -> 2937.52s]  other submissions that we received that we didn't hear in person. I'm not aware of the being
[2937.52s -> 2942.24s]  unique, but just thought, throughout the off fill, you've got your hand out. Yeah, just the Cambridge
[2942.24s -> 2946.24s]  neighborhood, neighborhood watch. We can't say for community trust on that board as well.
[2947.12s -> 2955.12s]  Okay, if we can note those, Jenny, that's at all possible. Okay, nobody asked having any other
[2956.64s -> 2961.44s]  conflicts, that's great. Listen, I thought I thought procedurally in terms of how we would deal
[2961.44s -> 2965.76s]  with these submissions today that rather than dealing with them on a chronological order,
[2966.32s -> 2970.56s]  after discussion with the governance team, we decided it was probably best and more logical
[2970.56s -> 2977.28s]  and efficient use of our time, if we dealt with them on by topic. And so as such, I'm kind of
[2977.28s -> 2984.40s]  hoping we can all agree on working off a Pindex 3, which relates, which groups all of our submissions
[2984.40s -> 2990.72s]  by topic. And in this way, we've, we've ground to be able to indicate to the executive relative
[2990.72s -> 2995.52s]  executive members and staff members for those subjects or issues to be here to help us in our
[2995.52s -> 3001.20s]  deliverations should we and need them. So I'm assuming everybody's comfortable with that approach.
[3002.00s -> 3008.08s]  Great, I'm waving your arm around. Yeah, just in terms of order that you might want to take
[3008.08s -> 3015.20s]  these categories, I did try and put some kind of logical sequence into the ordering of them,
[3015.20s -> 3021.20s]  but I noticed I've put fees and charges right at the end, which is actually a financial
[3021.20s -> 3027.44s]  one and the other's financial bits I've put right at the top. So you might want to consider moving
[3027.44s -> 3033.36s]  the fees and charges up. And I see that Tony Quickfall is here and he answered some of the questions
[3034.08s -> 3039.68s]  that one of the submitters had yesterday and he may well have some more information on that.
[3039.68s -> 3047.28s]  So that might be an opportunity to move that one third further up.
[3047.28s -> 3052.24s]  That is logical, that's a logical. I did have a little extra next to that one.
[3052.24s -> 3056.80s]  I'm flexible in whichever ones we deal with first and second but it makes sense to have those
[3056.80s -> 3062.00s]  financial matters all group together. If everybody's comfortable with that, I think that's probably
[3062.00s -> 3068.24s]  a good way forward. One other issue to raise is that a suggestion has been made that we may
[3068.24s -> 3073.44s]  wish to defer in any decision making on those with a financial component until we've seen the
[3073.44s -> 3078.56s]  revised annual plan and have fully considered all the issues raised by submitters and the wider
[3078.56s -> 3085.12s]  context. So that means delaying any decisions on those financial components until the June
[3085.12s -> 3090.40s]  night of June meeting. That's my understanding as a suggestion that has been made.
[3090.40s -> 3095.84s]  Are we comfortable with that process and we're entirely with the non financial issues today
[3095.84s -> 3101.92s]  and delaying till we have a clearer picture around those revised annual plan financial components
[3102.24s -> 3107.52s]  early next month. Right. Change logical. No, I'm just saying that's a logical approach.
[3107.52s -> 3113.92s]  Yeah, good approach. Yeah. Yeah, happy with that. Great. All right then.
[3114.48s -> 3118.72s]  Those are my housekeeping issues to attend to. I think we've squid away everything have we've
[3118.72s -> 3126.32s]  ground and you've read over there the year right now. I think so. Yes, just another note that
[3126.32s -> 3131.84s]  you will probably have noticed looking at appendix three that I had also ordered them by
[3132.32s -> 3139.76s]  the bigger categories first. So those were the ones that had the the most submission points.
[3140.56s -> 3147.92s]  So really around the submissions on the rates and the budgets. Community funding service
[3147.92s -> 3155.28s]  delivery, which is the roads, the footpaths, the waters, community services, the submissions around
[3155.28s -> 3164.00s]  libraries and parks and reserves and those kinds of services and then we're into those that
[3164.00s -> 3170.96s]  only have I think of the top of my head three, four, maybe five point seats. So and those are
[3170.96s -> 3178.40s]  probably fairly similar points as well. So the quickest ones to get out of the way of probably
[3178.40s -> 3185.68s]  at the bottom of the list. The the biggest effort are the ones at the top.
[3186.56s -> 3194.64s]  Okay, all right. So would it be a bit of use of everybody's time thinking here of staff as well
[3194.64s -> 3201.44s]  to perhaps square away the the easier smaller issues first and deal with the grant here larger
[3202.08s -> 3206.48s]  more contentious issues later or would you prefer the other way around. I'm easy. I'm led I'll be
[3206.48s -> 3214.48s]  led by what the what the committee would prefer in that respect. Anybody have an opinion on that?
[3217.20s -> 3221.92s]  Just happy with your suggestion Susan. Let's do the get the easy ones out the way in.
[3223.28s -> 3227.76s]  Okay, let's do it for me. Oh, I was just going to say as long as we can find it easily in our
[3227.76s -> 3232.72s]  and now appendix three, I don't be jumping all over place trying to find the right page that's all.
[3232.80s -> 3239.60s]  Yeah, it's it's really tricky. Really tricky because the other yeah. Yeah. And unfortunately zone meetings
[3239.60s -> 3244.16s]  that particularly helpful when it comes to hearings. I've actually got three screens going now.
[3244.16s -> 3252.08s]  You still have any headtoes. Yeah. Hazel. No, I'm just saying I find it really, really difficult
[3252.08s -> 3258.72s]  to jump all over the place. But I think the order that you sorted out is quite acceptable.
[3259.44s -> 3264.08s]  My memory is really right. I can actually remember what I've read and what's been said.
[3265.36s -> 3268.96s]  Okay, well, let's launch into it. With that said, would it make sense, given as we've
[3268.96s -> 3273.28s]  touched on it yesterday and Tony Cook falls here. Shall we shoot straight to the fees and charges
[3273.28s -> 3280.00s]  matter? Would that is a doable for everybody? So, versus I've pinned it three on page 43, I believe.
[3280.08s -> 3287.20s]  Oh, gosh. Tony, Tony gave a reasonably helpful steer yesterday. I wonder if you
[3287.20s -> 3293.60s]  had any further questions of Tony or discussion around those issues of fees and charges,
[3293.60s -> 3300.00s]  particularly with reference to the men from Pete McLaughlin's queries and some of the other
[3300.08s -> 3307.76s]  issues and their submissions. With you all from Ashane, I do really have some
[3307.76s -> 3313.84s]  further information around benchmarking. I worked last night just to validate my response as
[3313.84s -> 3319.36s]  around the benchmark, which was done earlier. But now I've gone back and done a little bit of
[3319.36s -> 3322.16s]  a different picture. So, I'm wondering what we were talking you through that a few of you have
[3322.48s -> 3327.20s]  been with that? Yeah, I think we split Tony. Sam, you're up to shoot at screen, please.
[3336.16s -> 3341.92s]  Okay, so I'll just take you through this. So, what we've got here is I'll take it through and
[3341.92s -> 3347.84s]  in the order that probably is basically a split up. So, the car was leveled one. It shows the
[3347.84s -> 3355.92s]  wife her fees and charges for the staff rates for 19 and 20. So, it's the current year in 2021,
[3355.92s -> 3364.00s]  which is what you're considering. The car was leveled totally. Comparable councils and the
[3364.00s -> 3368.16s]  worker origin. But also I've looked at wisdom by opportunity, which is comparable in size,
[3368.16s -> 3374.64s]  not a ton of study, just to compete up for the city. So, this benchmarking was done early on when
[3374.64s -> 3379.52s]  we went through the fees and charges review. I don't think it was done towards the, you know,
[3379.52s -> 3384.32s]  I think what might have happened to some of the figures that we put forward my age changed a little bit.
[3385.36s -> 3389.76s]  So, that's number one number two. What I've been done under the column is labeled three.
[3391.04s -> 3396.56s]  So, the first column on the left is an average amount of all the councils. Oh, sorry, if you
[3396.56s -> 3403.12s]  get it, columns two. The problem I had and doing this was that worker and topo here the fees and
[3403.12s -> 3409.76s]  charges probably available for 20, 21 or reading. The other councils still have them shown
[3409.76s -> 3414.64s]  as 19, 20. So, about next year's. So, if you go back to columns three, what are the first
[3414.64s -> 3420.00s]  as average across all the councils? In our maintenance assumption that for those councils,
[3420.00s -> 3428.32s]  they have not determined the 20, 21 fees and charges. I was shown the 2% inflation rate there.
[3429.28s -> 3433.92s]  Now, might be one, might be two, might be less, might more, but just for purposes of comparison,
[3433.92s -> 3441.12s]  that assumption is made. So, column four. I then went through the last consultants because we heard
[3441.12s -> 3447.28s]  that, I guess, there was a query around how we can be with the prior sector. I looked at three
[3447.28s -> 3454.96s]  consultants and the white part district. Product predominantly surveying companies that had
[3454.96s -> 3459.68s]  planners and engineers and also looked at two in Hamilton because we do, we are totally Hamilton
[3459.68s -> 3465.28s]  catchment. We are the highest growth council in the like of the region. I thought it was important
[3465.28s -> 3472.16s]  to provide that comparison with Hamilton because they do service as district as well. So, there's
[3472.16s -> 3480.00s]  a range in there, you'll see. So, what if we might be more useful, we'll do to look at our 2021
[3480.88s -> 3490.72s]  revised rates and compare with an average across all councils, including a 2% inflation. So,
[3490.72s -> 3497.12s]  it's the green columns. If you work your way down, notice, there are some disparities.
[3499.20s -> 3507.84s]  Overall, we do appear to be slightly higher than the average of all councils, but the point
[3507.84s -> 3517.20s]  to make there is that the 1920 current fees and charges are also slightly higher. So, you can
[3517.20s -> 3527.52s]  work the way through those. The other part of the August puzzle is what, what is our target in
[3527.52s -> 3531.92s]  terms of recovering fees and charges and how are we tracking? So, if you go to the bottom of the
[3531.92s -> 3538.40s]  spreadsheet, under the long-term plan financial policy, and that's what I was talking about yesterday,
[3538.40s -> 3543.20s]  our underlying financial policy hasn't changed. So, we're looking at it as the rate. So,
[3543.20s -> 3549.84s]  our current LTP financial policy sees that for resource management, the target is to recover 45 to 70%
[3550.88s -> 3559.52s]  of costs through fees and charges. The development engineering, the target is 30 to 50%
[3560.16s -> 3567.04s]  by the end of an analysis of year to March, which is the most recent report I could find,
[3567.04s -> 3571.76s]  and the year to day actuals, we're tracking around 50% recovery for resource management,
[3572.32s -> 3577.92s]  in 37% recovery for development engineering. So, the picture is told,
[3578.64s -> 3585.36s]  is that while this year's fees and charges may be slightly higher than the average of all councils,
[3586.32s -> 3592.32s]  every recovery is not at the high side. So, we're actually recovering at the low end of
[3592.32s -> 3599.92s]  what our target is. What that says to me is that we can tell the story that our rates
[3601.44s -> 3608.72s]  reasonable and fear, and that's the test of the RMA requires, or acre and reasonable,
[3608.72s -> 3613.76s]  sorry, actual and reasonable. Now, I think if you look at our target for recovery and our
[3613.76s -> 3620.24s]  actually recovery rates, we're not making a profit or a big surplus on that. So, I think you can
[3620.24s -> 3625.20s]  have a level of comfort that our rates, even though they may appear slightly higher,
[3626.32s -> 3633.76s]  and not putting that into a big financial surplus situation. So, that's all the information of
[3633.76s -> 3638.56s]  page. I'm happy if you want to work through it, or look at it, or deliver it out later,
[3638.56s -> 3646.08s]  but I thought the views would have to conform to this. Thanks for that, Tony. Does anybody have
[3646.08s -> 3654.56s]  a question or query of Tony? Does that chart in particular? I agree. Yeah, thanks very much, Tony.
[3654.56s -> 3658.32s]  It's great to get that chart, which, you know, we didn't have that when we were reading the
[3658.32s -> 3664.64s]  submissions that you used the two in slightly higher for Viper compared to the rest, but actually
[3664.64s -> 3675.60s]  some of the $20 an hour higher, which I think is seems excessive to me. I would have expected
[3676.40s -> 3684.16s]  larger city councils to have higher rates. So, like Hamilton City, maybe Turan City,
[3684.64s -> 3690.88s]  yeah. So, you know, we're higher than them significantly. We need to think about the hourly rate.
[3691.68s -> 3701.28s]  And so, I appreciate you going into the LTP policy and the recoveries. And so, my question is,
[3702.16s -> 3709.76s]  are we seeking to recover too many indirect costs? Because I think this was some covered in the submission
[3710.64s -> 3718.48s]  from conswells that because we're a council, you know, we're not trying to make a profit. So,
[3719.20s -> 3726.08s]  it would be a reasonable expectation that our hourly rate would actually be a discount on the private
[3726.08s -> 3731.76s]  sector. Okay, now the only way that we wouldn't be having a discount is if we are trying to
[3731.76s -> 3738.88s]  recover our overheads as well and a larger proportion of our overheads than a private company.
[3739.44s -> 3746.00s]  And so, I'd appreciate a bit more analysis on that, or you know, I suppose a full analysis on the
[3746.00s -> 3751.60s]  financial policy and whether or not we're including more indirect costs than perhaps might not be
[3751.60s -> 3757.36s]  anticipated through the R&A. Oh, I haven't got those figures yet, but I'm what I can say is under
[3757.44s -> 3764.40s]  a feast in charge as policy. We're on trial to claim for any actual and reasonable costs and
[3764.40s -> 3771.28s]  curd for the dairy costs. All the invocers that go out, we do use a time sheet system. So,
[3771.28s -> 3776.80s]  anyone who's tracking costs against the constraints that come in and net applies to development
[3776.80s -> 3782.56s]  in here as well, use a time sheet system. We've got prices in place where they are checked before
[3782.56s -> 3786.96s]  they go out. You know, I've got a high level of confidence that we're not claiming what we're
[3786.96s -> 3795.68s]  not entitled to. In effect often, as I indicated, we make a bit of a judgment call and often,
[3795.68s -> 3800.88s]  we do discount the actual errors because we take a reasonable test as well, reasonably honest test.
[3803.20s -> 3807.36s]  Graham, you've got a question there. Oh, sorry, did you have any further to ask clear?
[3808.32s -> 3814.00s]  Well, I was going to say, yeah, I mean, I appreciate the comments about that you do make a call,
[3814.00s -> 3818.72s]  you know, on what's reasonable and fear that part of the submission, though, was that the
[3818.72s -> 3824.16s]  hours that have been charged do seem to be excessive as well for straightforward concerns.
[3825.04s -> 3829.76s]  I think they gave examples, you know, of seven or nine hours or something for
[3829.76s -> 3834.96s]  something that they would have expected to be pretty straightforward for an engineer. And so,
[3835.04s -> 3840.48s]  yeah, I guess I'd like a bit more investigation. So, that may have been relating to
[3841.04s -> 3846.56s]  two or three particular and voices that we have discussed with Commonwealth. And there was one
[3846.56s -> 3850.32s]  instance that we had to go back to the consultant who was processing to ask in to reduce the
[3850.32s -> 3855.92s]  fees. When you go shared it there and we reviewed our own voices. So, well, there were one or two
[3855.92s -> 3862.64s]  exceptions. I'm quite confident in the washing process takes into account the actual errors that we
[3862.72s -> 3867.12s]  would normally expect as well. Okay, so it's so you've looked in the to those instances.
[3867.12s -> 3873.52s]  Yeah, okay, right, I think it's very much. Thanks for that. I'm Graham, did you head your hand?
[3873.52s -> 3879.04s]  Yeah, thanks. Tony, the bottom, the bottom figures on your recovery. If you look into it,
[3879.04s -> 3887.04s]  probably indicate that you could well be during the conceits for less time, because you're not
[3887.04s -> 3892.24s]  excessively recovering charges, you're in the middle to low, if you know what I mean. So,
[3892.24s -> 3898.16s]  you might be slightly higher out, but it'll be interesting to know what their averages compete
[3898.16s -> 3901.44s]  with some other parameters in the other councils. That's all.
[3907.36s -> 3912.88s]  Andrew, did you have a question there? Yeah, well, not so much a question. Look, this is a
[3912.88s -> 3920.32s]  legitimate query from an interested rate payer, but it's, it's, our council staff have just told us
[3920.32s -> 3926.40s]  that they're comfortable, that they're applying the rules. They're allowed to, to recover charges.
[3927.04s -> 3934.08s]  And we need to understand that, of course, the more fees are to recover the less rates we have to
[3934.08s -> 3941.44s]  charge our ratepayers. So, there's always that balance. And our rates are going to be coming up
[3941.44s -> 3947.76s]  for a group. The whole process comes up for a view in the, in the natural order of things. And
[3948.56s -> 3954.08s]  yeah, I think we just need to say this is noted. It's going to be looked at in the, in the due course.
[3954.08s -> 3959.84s]  Any exceptions dealt with as they come up as Tony's just explained. And, you know, let's move on.
[3961.84s -> 3967.12s]  I can, you're waving your hand around there. You're muted, can.
[3967.36s -> 3975.92s]  And, yes, sorry, I was just going to just say that they're probably right now in year three of an
[3975.92s -> 3982.40s]  LTP is probably not the best time of, of, of looking at this. And so, so we're, obviously,
[3982.40s -> 3988.40s]  and over the next year or so, we are putting to give it an LTP as part of that process. We review
[3988.40s -> 3995.04s]  our revenue and finance policy. So, so, those figures at the bottom of the screen with the, with the,
[3995.04s -> 4000.16s]  with the bandings of, we, we want to, our fees and charges to set. Yeah, we, um, yeah, we'll,
[4000.16s -> 4005.68s]  we'll obviously review that in the next, in the next year as we've lead into, to the LTP. And usually,
[4005.68s -> 4010.96s]  when we do that, in fact, always when we do that, and this sort of area, and we compare our
[4010.96s -> 4016.64s]  fee recovery bandings against the, of our, of our, of our peers. Okay, so it's so against some
[4016.64s -> 4022.00s]  neighbouring council, so it's, so we'll make sure that we do that. And also, um, also, um, yeah,
[4022.00s -> 4026.88s]  the lead up to an LTP, we actually review our overheat models, because there have been some,
[4026.88s -> 4030.80s]  some coming, some, in terms of what, you know, what overheat some re-recovering,
[4030.80s -> 4035.12s]  um, that that will be a key focus in the next year as well, as we, um, as we call to give
[4035.12s -> 4040.00s]  an LTP. So, um, yeah, so, so, so, so, so, so I would suggest, um, I mean, that's a,
[4040.00s -> 4044.16s]  as the first time I've seen those figures, they're, um, they're Tony's just some presenter.
[4044.16s -> 4049.04s]  But, but to me, they didn't look, um, they didn't look really out of filter. Um, yes,
[4049.20s -> 4053.44s]  I appreciate, they didn't look a little bit hard in some of our peers, um, but I just say
[4053.44s -> 4059.12s]  there's quite a few considerations here. They don't look wildly out, um, and we will quite
[4059.12s -> 4062.96s]  naturally review those things, um, over the next year anyway.
[4065.04s -> 4068.72s]  Right. Thanks for that, Ken. Uh, Gary, you're waving your hand around the effect.
[4070.72s -> 4075.44s]  Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, so just to clear this point about, uh, we're recovering
[4075.44s -> 4081.28s]  an appropriate level of indirect costs. Um, that's something we'll look at with our overhead model.
[4081.28s -> 4087.44s]  But audit New Zealand have done some work around, uh, an appropriate multiplier of direct costs.
[4087.44s -> 4093.92s]  And, uh, whereas the private sector would sit at a multiplier of around about 2.7, um,
[4093.92s -> 4099.20s]  local government teams decided about 2.1. So, when we review our overhead allocation, we'll just
[4099.20s -> 4103.60s]  review back to that audit New Zealand Wiga, Magical Wistel, uh, charging,
[4103.60s -> 4109.20s]  and direct costs in appropriate level. Right. Thanks for that. Mike, did you have a question?
[4111.60s -> 4117.36s]  Um, you know, thank you with that, Madam Chair. Yeah, I guess the fees is, as, as hard
[4117.36s -> 4122.08s]  the equation, but as alluded to, uh, and the efficiencies that can be made is definitely
[4122.08s -> 4126.16s]  the other half because it's, it's, it's not just the money, it's money times time,
[4126.16s -> 4132.08s]  gets you to a final account. So the early rate in the end can be x, but um, but if it's time
[4132.08s -> 4136.16s]  by more hours because we haven't looked at the efficiencies, then the bill is, you know,
[4136.16s -> 4139.44s]  always possibly going to be more than it could be. So, I guess if we just take a
[4139.44s -> 4145.04s]  cause and approach is, you know, to tend to miss their continuous improvement. Um, yeah, when it's
[4145.04s -> 4148.80s]  time to look at this, it's just looking at, you know, all the technology and all the time,
[4148.80s -> 4153.28s]  it's never been asked that going to craving these, um, fear amounts and just,
[4153.28s -> 4161.28s]  other of any efficiencies within that to reduce the time. Yeah, great. Okay. Good point,
[4161.76s -> 4168.64s]  Mike and Roger, how do you go to question? Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.
[4168.64s -> 4176.08s]  An interesting discussion for me, it seems to be that the, the, the end is what is the,
[4176.08s -> 4180.64s]  the quantum or the dollar value of the recovery that's coming in that's contributing to a budget.
[4181.52s -> 4189.52s]  And that, uh, the equation that drives that is a question of what dollar value do we charge
[4189.60s -> 4195.60s]  per hour and how much of the total time that's committed to that project is, is charged and
[4195.60s -> 4203.36s]  I'm assuming that when you say the percentage of recovery, then there are a number of hours
[4203.36s -> 4211.68s]  that are not charged out that relate to that particular event. So, um, I'd be interested in
[4211.68s -> 4217.44s]  having a look at that chart that's sent through, but maybe have a look at the, uh, the overall
[4217.44s -> 4223.28s]  contribution to the, the dollar value at the end of the day. Is that relevant to me?
[4225.68s -> 4230.24s]  Uh, I find it's time the question is, is that the total invoicing that we are
[4231.20s -> 4235.52s]  invoicing for applications, that the total amount? Yep.
[4236.72s -> 4243.20s]  Um, it is now that I'm picking up on, um, Councillor Fedett's query or or coming to a round time as
[4243.20s -> 4248.80s]  the other factor. Um, so we had had a couple of instances, um, I guess beating in with some new
[4248.80s -> 4252.96s]  staff and you consultants that have alluded to with, with Colctwell, we they challenged
[4252.96s -> 4259.92s]  a couple of invoices who were there through with them. Um, it's very, there would be a very,
[4259.92s -> 4265.52s]  we could do that, but there would need to be almost an individual application basis and the reason
[4265.52s -> 4270.16s]  for that is all the applications are different. They can click see the applications,
[4270.16s -> 4274.88s]  rangered widely and the other comment probably to make us to the early efficiencies,
[4274.88s -> 4279.12s]  dependent on the information we receive from the applicants themselves and the consultants
[4279.84s -> 4285.28s]  and the quality of their device. Um, what I can say is that we've had one submission from
[4285.28s -> 4292.64s]  one submitter, which is raised valid questions. But to me, if there is a systemic issue around our
[4292.64s -> 4299.60s]  rates, we would have had multiple submissions from multiple consultants. So often we're in a
[4299.60s -> 4306.48s]  situation where we is the heft to spend more time because we have to ask more information
[4306.48s -> 4311.68s]  in order to make an informed decision on the applications. So, sorry, it's a long answer.
[4311.68s -> 4316.88s]  Um, yes, we could provide some analysis of that, but it would need to be almost down to an
[4316.88s -> 4320.56s]  application level into explaining the complexity of each application as well.
[4323.44s -> 4326.40s]  Yep. I appreciate that. Yep. That's okay. Thank you.
[4327.36s -> 4334.88s]  Just, uh, perhaps I can just follow one from Tony. Um, yeah, we're going to total cost of running a
[4334.88s -> 4342.24s]  painting, um, for example, you're just not going to recover the total cost of any cost of that team.
[4342.24s -> 4347.92s]  There are a lot of public good components associated with running the team. There's countermeain
[4347.92s -> 4355.12s]  queries that might be purchasing applications for community or other clubs that we just don't charge
[4355.12s -> 4361.84s]  for or the MIT Fresh Chargers that, um, you know, we don't become a balance cost of such as
[4361.84s -> 4367.12s]  popular ticket to trees or heritage buildings or likes. So I just might at the point that, um,
[4367.12s -> 4373.28s]  that's why, um, you know, teams are referring to the funding policy, why it's, um,
[4373.28s -> 4378.32s]  relatively low in the painting era, taking care to the building, because in the era, we are
[4378.32s -> 4384.48s]  the majority of costs, um, a simply purchasing applications, we're doing this session, we can recover
[4384.56s -> 4394.40s]  the majority of all time. So, um, all right. Okay, I think I've got, oh, I think we're just
[4394.40s -> 4398.96s]  shrink this down. So I can say everybody, you know, other questions there for, of Tony and
[4398.96s -> 4405.04s]  respect of those specific queries raised by a college world. Great. Well, you'll see in your submissions
[4405.04s -> 4410.64s]  that those questions or issues related to submit a number of liven. So, perhaps if we go to the
[4410.64s -> 4415.04s]  beginning of the fees and charges, and remember, of course, we're not going to be making any
[4416.16s -> 4420.24s]  decisions today around these as our financial matters would defer our decision making to
[4420.24s -> 4425.36s]  let aid to the ninth rather. But I thought it would be helpful if we just, in short, to ensure
[4425.36s -> 4431.04s]  we actually addressed every submission, went through them within those categories. So on my page,
[4431.04s -> 4440.24s]  43 of appendix 3, and it's the entitled fees and charges, and the first, um, the
[4440.24s -> 4445.52s]  first several here, if I submit a number seven, it obviously relates to look a licensing. Have we
[4445.52s -> 4454.08s]  got any queries or questions or just points of discussion and respect of those, um, submissions?
[4458.48s -> 4464.32s]  On Susan, I'm really happy with the staff comments, you know, they've given good explanation
[4464.88s -> 4470.00s]  as to whether it's possible to reduce the fees or why it's not viable, or the fact that we are
[4470.00s -> 4475.52s]  going through a detailed process we were looking at what we can, um, you know, and I'm really
[4475.52s -> 4480.32s]  happy with all those comments. I think it's pretty straightforward, isn't it? If we don't hit
[4480.32s -> 4485.28s]  jurisdiction, it's something that doesn't rest with us, it's something outside of our, um,
[4485.28s -> 4490.08s]  fish to fry, so to speak. So, if they're being now through the discussion and respect of those,
[4490.08s -> 4495.44s]  look a licensing submissions, um, did have a night down there, but I think.
[4501.28s -> 4507.60s]  I had actually a question on seven point four. The staff comments says fees under the
[4507.60s -> 4514.80s]  sale and supply of alcohol at 2012 are set by regulation, not by cancer. To date, there have been
[4514.88s -> 4519.36s]  indication from central government. Is that, are we missing a word there? Should it be there?
[4519.36s -> 4525.20s]  Has has been no indication? Or there have been indications? I wasn't quite sure of the sense of that.
[4526.08s -> 4532.96s]  Yes, Chair, I think you're quite correct, but um, there does appear to be the word no missing.
[4534.16s -> 4540.24s]  I think we can just confirm that with Carl, but I'm pretty sure that we missed the word out there.
[4540.24s -> 4545.36s]  Yeah, Carl, I guess it's much, but I thought I'd just clarify because it's a reasonably important
[4545.36s -> 4552.48s]  note. Yeah, that's correct. Great, I think Carl, thank you for that. In no questions of Carl,
[4552.48s -> 4558.24s]  I'll be saying this, this measure, and we can move on. No, no questions, Greg.
[4559.20s -> 4560.24s]  Here's a question.
[4560.24s -> 4561.28s]  Aren't partial dust?
[4561.28s -> 4562.24s]  I know.
[4563.84s -> 4571.04s]  Oh, actually I don't. If I raise my hand, if I keep you on a raise my hand, it means I want to
[4571.04s -> 4574.32s]  speak, but I don't at the moment. Thank you. Okay, thanks, Clonso.
[4576.80s -> 4582.16s]  Okay, so on the basis, we're comfortable with those recommendations there. We'll move on to the next
[4582.16s -> 4589.84s]  submission point for discussion, which is adopting the comments. The submission, if you like,
[4589.84s -> 4594.88s]  can be summarized by indicating that there was a suggestion that we adopt aspects of the Hamilton
[4594.88s -> 4602.32s]  City Council's 12-point recovery plan. There seems to have been a response there that
[4602.32s -> 4607.20s]  seems to mine mind to be reasonably comprehensive. Has anybody got anything they want to discuss
[4607.20s -> 4614.56s]  on that? No, we're fine with that one. I could just take these off as we go through.
[4617.68s -> 4624.00s]  The next one may have more discussion and reference to deferring proposed development
[4624.00s -> 4629.84s]  contribution fee increases. There is a staff comment there suggesting that Council will look at
[4629.84s -> 4635.04s]  different and development contribution funding models and the app and coming 2021 review of the
[4635.04s -> 4639.28s]  DC policy. So I think that gives some hope perhaps there for the submission.
[4642.24s -> 4646.64s]  Any comments or questions? Any comments? They're likely to go up, not down.
[4647.68s -> 4654.48s]  Well, you know, you never know, you never know. No other questions or comments. Okay,
[4654.48s -> 4660.64s]  and we've dealt with submission number 11. So we can move on. Yeah, there are more points that
[4660.64s -> 4671.60s]  submit at 11 included. It wasn't just the RMA fees. Okay. So particularly around 11.3,
[4671.60s -> 4681.52s]  I pretty hear and 11.4. Okay. Just just a point chair that if Councillors are comfortable with
[4682.56s -> 4689.04s]  making decisions on any of these ends, no reason why you shouldn't. It's just where you're not
[4689.12s -> 4697.12s]  comfortable in any of the financial decisions at this stage because of the revisions to
[4697.92s -> 4706.32s]  budgets, then you may wish to defer to a later date, but there's no compulsion to do so.
[4706.32s -> 4711.04s]  Okay. Well, it that way. Okay. In fact, the more decisions we get today,
[4711.84s -> 4718.00s]  these are it's going to be for us all, I think. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. So the
[4719.92s -> 4725.44s]  where are we? They look a licensing measure. Sorry, I'm just trying to get my computer going
[4725.44s -> 4736.24s]  properly. It's just decided to go crazy on me. We're happy to do that because it is
[4736.24s -> 4742.88s]  financial. But on the other hand, everyone seemed to be. Oh, actually, no, yeah, no, you're right.
[4742.88s -> 4747.28s]  Recommendations. Yeah, no, you're, you're curious. Thank you. So if you're not feeling
[4747.28s -> 4753.60s]  comfortable with making a financial decision at this stage without seeing the revisions to
[4753.60s -> 4762.00s]  the budgets, then we would suggest that you should should defer. Maybe that you want to just
[4762.00s -> 4766.80s]  decide that you're going to support the staff recommendation, which might be to consider that
[4766.80s -> 4772.32s]  as part of the annual plan financials. As well, that could be a decision that you
[4773.20s -> 4779.92s]  you make little and then decide later on on the actual subject matter. Okay. So is it your preference
[4780.80s -> 4786.24s]  Graham and and or drove that we deal with each recommendation squared away and then we can move on.
[4786.88s -> 4791.04s]  Yeah, for you, Madam Chair, that is certainly the preference. With regard to
[4792.64s -> 4798.56s]  to those community funding applications, if you, you know, ideally, you would make a decision today,
[4798.56s -> 4803.92s]  but if you wish to look at those and the wider content stuff that the overall budget,
[4803.92s -> 4808.08s]  then that possibly something that you may wish to defer. But ideally, we will work through these
[4809.12s -> 4816.00s]  item by item and make a recommendation. Okay. So if we just back up a little bit to the
[4816.00s -> 4820.40s]  district licensing once you will clear those away then, can I take it? We're all comfortable with
[4820.40s -> 4827.20s]  the recommendations given by staff on submission points, 7.3 and 7.4. Yep. Do you need anything
[4827.20s -> 4834.24s]  further from me on that one and we can move on? That's fine. Perfect. Adopting aspects. So this is
[4834.24s -> 4840.16s]  10.8, which is the representative to adopt aspects of the Hamiltonity Council's 12, 12-point recovery
[4840.16s -> 4845.44s]  plan. We comfortable with the recommendation that Council just thinks is a submission for this
[4845.44s -> 4853.76s]  suggestion. Yes, I'm uncomfortable because I've seemed to recollect some way through this
[4853.84s -> 4861.04s]  looking at the, the white at a regional recovery plan and somehow the white part recovery plan
[4861.04s -> 4868.24s]  is somewhere within all of that. And so, you know, why do we need to be going into, let's just,
[4868.24s -> 4875.04s]  let's just work with what's happening. I don't know, others may have a different opinion.
[4876.32s -> 4881.68s]  Jim, you might have a different opinion as to how quickly and we're all this is going to happen.
[4881.68s -> 4888.00s]  But I think this is very much part of the changing environment that we are now about to face
[4888.88s -> 4894.32s]  because of COVID-19. But yes, just looking, what's all really being done?
[4896.16s -> 4903.04s]  I don't know, that was my, anyway, that's my opinion. Thank you, Hazel. So we're comfortable with
[4903.04s -> 4909.68s]  that recommendation as a committee. Yes. Oh, no, Lowe's got your hand up. Yes, thank you,
[4909.68s -> 4913.12s]  you know, through you, Matt and Chair, I'm quite supportive of that. Because I think we need to
[4913.12s -> 4919.28s]  cooperate as as a Council with our Councils around us with this recovery process. And I think it's
[4919.28s -> 4925.04s]  essential that we work together and collectively achieve a better, much better objectives. So I do
[4925.04s -> 4930.56s]  think that we do need to work together. And I think this is a very comfortable with it. So thank you.
[4931.92s -> 4936.88s]  Thanks for coming, Lowe. So I'd be able to say with Roger, have you a question?
[4937.52s -> 4943.68s]  I'm coming. Oh, just a question. I'm not too sure I've seen the 12 point Hamilton city recovery plan.
[4947.92s -> 4953.44s]  I'm not doing anything right. I can email it out to you if you want to. Thank you.
[4955.04s -> 4960.16s]  Jim. Oh, those and Jim, Justin on that 12 point plan. And I agree with Lowe's
[4960.16s -> 4966.72s]  coming, so we've obviously got to work together. But, and I haven't got it in front of me now,
[4966.72s -> 4973.68s]  but I did read it. But my recollection is that there was quite a lot of social giving away
[4974.48s -> 4981.68s]  funds, et cetera, in that 12 point plan that we may not well want to go along with. And whilst I
[4981.68s -> 4988.32s]  support the concept of working together, we've got to sort this problem out regionally and
[4988.32s -> 4994.40s]  nationally, probably, but I think just acknowledging that we've taken account of it, but we're
[4994.40s -> 4999.36s]  not necessarily just going to blindly follow what the city says. Yeah, exactly.
[5000.56s -> 5007.36s]  Agreed. Yeah, agreed. Okay. Right. Well, we're comfortable by a large with that recommendation.
[5007.36s -> 5012.40s]  Moving on to the next point of submission, which is 10.9, relating to the
[5012.80s -> 5018.48s]  development contribution. I think we can agree that that is a financial matter, which probably
[5018.48s -> 5025.28s]  gets to fear until the 9th of June. So we'll defer that one. I'll just write that on my page.
[5025.28s -> 5034.96s]  Otherwise, I will get completely lost. So then that moves us into the cogswell submissions,
[5034.96s -> 5041.60s]  which is a 11 point one with address that. Is that correct? I mean, they shouldn't.
[5041.60s -> 5048.56s]  Yeah. I mean, at the submission, yesterday when they made their presentation,
[5048.56s -> 5056.48s]  it was a comment about cogswells or other developers and agents, wanting to work more closely with
[5056.48s -> 5064.08s]  council in refining these processes to get greater efficiencies. And I'm sure that Tony said something
[5064.08s -> 5072.16s]  like, yes, yeah, we want to do that. And so the response is actually that it's actually
[5072.16s -> 5079.12s]  staff that are going to work on the continuous improvement and then meet agents now. So I just think
[5080.08s -> 5087.60s]  I'd like to see a slightly different response to reflek that staff are open to working with agents
[5088.08s -> 5094.88s]  to try and get greater efficiencies. Okay, perhaps I'm misunderstood what Tony said. I don't know.
[5096.16s -> 5105.76s]  No, no, so you're right. We are really working with consultants on a case by case basis.
[5105.76s -> 5111.20s]  So we do have continuous improvement. We don't have a planned program of actively planning
[5111.20s -> 5116.56s]  up to all the consultants to look at all their processes and do a major overall. That's quite a complex
[5116.56s -> 5123.28s]  process. So I guess what I was trying to get across is it's more of a case by case as needed.
[5123.28s -> 5127.44s]  It is things crop up and often well identified in ourselves as well. So it's not always
[5128.32s -> 5133.20s]  custom identified. We'll look at something and say we can do this better. So that's the process
[5133.20s -> 5140.64s]  we're quite. Yeah, so I'd like that reflected in the response. And at the moment it says,
[5140.64s -> 5151.60s]  your point is noted, but no changes are recommended. And so I mean, I'd rather say that
[5154.48s -> 5161.52s]  that opportunities are for us deficiencies are considered as their rise and
[5162.24s -> 5167.44s]  and you know, we do work with that because on a case by case basis or something.
[5172.96s -> 5178.56s]  Yeah, I think that would better reflect the discussions that were had and certainly the
[5178.56s -> 5184.48s]  staff position I would think, Tony. So Graham, are you in the position of re-wielding that or
[5184.48s -> 5193.36s]  as Jenny or? I think Jenny's or some were working on on this if they can keep firm that
[5193.36s -> 5199.12s]  be good. Oh, you know, we are both of us. Excellent. Fantastic.
[5204.80s -> 5208.08s]  So do you want me to wait for that or should we move on to the next one?
[5208.72s -> 5215.92s]  What we could do a table if you and we're populating that with where you're supporting this
[5215.92s -> 5220.00s]  submission and we'll pop in the comments to the side. So if you want to add the end of the phase
[5220.00s -> 5225.36s]  and charters, if we just cheer the screen, just kind of wrap that up and just confirm where
[5225.36s -> 5229.76s]  one's at, if that works, that would be good. Yeah, that's great. Thanks, Joe. Okay, well,
[5229.76s -> 5235.20s]  well, that being the case will move on to the the next one we discussed obviously fairly comprehensively.
[5236.16s -> 5240.48s]  Again, it touches on financial matters. I'm assuming we'll be in a position where we would rather
[5240.48s -> 5245.76s]  defer any clear decision-making on that request until the ninth.
[5246.64s -> 5250.64s]  Hazel, are you going to be paying attention to the comments? I appreciate you telling us
[5251.36s -> 5258.48s]  which number it is and and the point number that I can quickly find it. Yeah, yeah,
[5258.48s -> 5265.84s]  do you want? Yeah, you'll be so far so that I can be part of, you know, yeah, it's at pay at
[5265.84s -> 5273.68s]  point 11.2 on page 45. Yep, got that. Okay, so the rightness summing that this will be deferred
[5273.68s -> 5277.84s]  it is it's of a financial nature and not a standing with hits and pretty far discussion on it today.
[5278.88s -> 5285.76s]  So it depends whether the committee are comfortable with with that with accepting it or not.
[5285.76s -> 5295.84s]  Yeah, what's the feel people? Andrew? Yeah, look, I don't think we're in a position to
[5296.40s -> 5305.68s]  make any changes to staff processes at at this time. Yes, we can commit to review
[5305.68s -> 5311.68s]  in the appropriate times, but we just can't say we're going to cut DCs or we're going to
[5311.68s -> 5321.84s]  reduce fees and charges willy-nilly. It doesn't make any sense. It's, it's, I think the
[5321.84s -> 5328.40s]  recommendations are all quite clear. I'm not sure I can't see where the responses are and
[5329.60s -> 5336.48s]  and just appendix three to the actual submothers, but all of all the recommendations and
[5336.48s -> 5346.64s]  responses seem quite appropriate as far as I can see. And Susan, yeah. What I'd like to see reflected
[5346.64s -> 5354.08s]  in the response is that we will look at reviewing them, you know, that perhaps the, you know,
[5354.08s -> 5360.56s]  the points raised, you know, have prompted us to review and like there's the work that's
[5360.56s -> 5364.32s]  Tony's been doing, he's been looking at the wider context, you know, the rats from other
[5364.40s -> 5368.80s]  councils and consultants, but at this point, you know, we can't make a decision as an
[5368.80s -> 5373.12s]  Andrew said, you know, two reduce them, but I think the submitter would probably appreciate
[5373.68s -> 5379.04s]  knowing that because of what information I presented that we are doing the reviews to make sure
[5379.04s -> 5386.64s]  that, you know, our fees and charges are reasonable and clear. And at the moment, that's not really
[5386.64s -> 5392.56s]  in the air. So would, would you prefer that there be a change to that recommendation to say more
[5392.56s -> 5399.12s]  than the status quo is maintained? Yeah, that that there's submission has, has prompted us to
[5399.12s -> 5405.60s]  initiate a review. I mean, that's going to take time, you know, but, yeah, you're keen, you're
[5405.60s -> 5409.68s]  waving your hand around, yeah. Yeah, I was just going to say, I'm like, I see you know,
[5409.68s -> 5414.72s]  I'm a few minutes ago that we would do this quite naturally anyway, as part of our LTP.
[5415.52s -> 5420.96s]  So, you know, so, so, so, so look, we could suit me change the comment and indicate that we
[5420.96s -> 5426.08s]  every three years we do, yeah, we do review our review, our financing policy, and our overheat
[5426.08s -> 5432.00s]  models. So, so we will do that over over the next year. Yeah, that would be great.
[5433.04s -> 5439.76s]  That makes sense. More, more product, yeah. Okay, so I take it, Jenny, we're going to
[5439.76s -> 5445.20s]  amend that recommendations slightly and if we can then move on to submission point 11,
[5445.20s -> 5449.76s]  that's so 11.3 on page 35. It's relating to the RETEC manager.
[5449.92s -> 5454.80s]  That's fine, Susan. Thank you. Cool. Have we got any comments on that?
[5454.80s -> 5460.00s]  Tony, did you have anything to add on this or clear a question? Oh, Roger, you're asking a question.
[5460.00s -> 5467.60s]  Yeah, I just have a question. What is RETEC manager? Is this a new software that we're using?
[5467.60s -> 5471.28s]  Is it new process? I honestly don't know what it is.
[5472.40s -> 5478.00s]  To kill action manager of the order? Yeah. Tony, you can perhaps answer that more as
[5478.00s -> 5482.40s]  succinctly and more learn at the night, learn at lead the night game. I had the same
[5483.44s -> 5488.48s]  on this query as Councillor Gourmet. I'm assuming that's reticulation manager.
[5489.52s -> 5493.84s]  And it would then relate to probably the services department of the organization.
[5494.64s -> 5501.28s]  Graham, you're right. I think I have some knowledge on this because I fell into the same trap
[5501.28s -> 5507.60s]  of changing RETEC manager to reticulation manager thinking it was a job title. I believe it is
[5507.60s -> 5514.32s]  sort of software called RETEC manager. I understand it's to do with examining the
[5516.08s -> 5523.92s]  the status or the condition of pipe work underground. So it's part of sort of a
[5524.72s -> 5533.36s]  CCTV camera inspection of pipe work to check that it's been installed properly from the inside.
[5533.36s -> 5540.24s]  That it's in good quality. There's bit purpose. If it's going to be taken over as a council
[5540.24s -> 5546.48s]  asset, we need to know that in advance and that everything is OK with it. So that's what I
[5546.48s -> 5556.16s]  understand. I can't see Martin on the meeting at the moment. Martin molds. So that was the
[5556.16s -> 5561.84s]  information that he provided to me. That's my understanding of the information he provided to me.
[5561.92s -> 5566.48s]  Let me put it that way. Thank you for that clarification Graham. Roger.
[5567.36s -> 5571.84s]  Yeah. I'd just like more information on it than if we're going to make a decision on that.
[5573.36s -> 5578.96s]  Just a little bit more about what the value is to the organization, what the cost is. I mean,
[5580.08s -> 5584.64s]  to be honest, we just don't we can't make a decision on that until we get some more information.
[5586.64s -> 5590.64s]  Does anybody else have an opinion or a comment to make about that particular submission?
[5590.64s -> 5597.12s]  Susan Graham here now, it is what it is and before the council takes up a vested asset,
[5597.12s -> 5601.04s]  especially in a new submission, they want to know what they're taking over and they're fit for
[5601.04s -> 5604.08s]  purpose and whether they'll be joint correctly, they have any blockages in them.
[5604.08s -> 5607.60s]  And it's fair and the impact on council means they don't have to come back and revisit it.
[5610.00s -> 5614.88s]  Okay. So Andrew, did you have some study? Well, yeah, it just seems like the developers are
[5614.88s -> 5620.56s]  asking us to take over assets that we don't know what what the quality or whatever is and
[5620.56s -> 5626.72s]  the recommendation seems entirely appropriate to me. Yeah. Okay. So can I take it the best general
[5627.28s -> 5631.68s]  agreement about that recommendation and we're comfortable with a screen that went away this
[5631.68s -> 5639.60s]  afternoon this morning. Yeah. Happy Susan. Yeah. Cool. Okay. So that one is confirmed and moving on
[5639.60s -> 5647.12s]  then to point 11.4. This is water connection charges and consistent. It should all be charged
[5647.12s -> 5652.08s]  at the urban rate. We have some staff comments there and the recommendation is that council
[5652.08s -> 5656.16s]  thinks it's a matter of a person. It's the urban rural fee structure to be appropriate and should
[5656.16s -> 5665.44s]  continue. It seems to be some nodding heads around the place. Anybody? I think I think this one's
[5665.44s -> 5670.00s]  gone. I think that the, you know, when we discussed it, he's today the submission. It was largely
[5670.00s -> 5675.12s]  due to the popular remote scheme and the challenges that we've got there. So yeah. Okay. So we're
[5675.12s -> 5681.12s]  comfortable with squaring away that confirming that recommendation. Yes, I think we are. Okay.
[5681.12s -> 5687.20s]  Great. Take that one off. I'm going to take them off as I go or I'll get highly confused.
[5688.72s -> 5692.96s]  Moving on to another second. So I'm leaving a 18.1.
[5693.92s -> 5700.96s]  This is a respective DCs. Does anybody have a particular position they want to
[5701.60s -> 5708.32s]  express on this particular submission? We have a recommendation that the fees are accepted and
[5708.32s -> 5712.96s]  staff continue to pursue the offer. Obviously made by the submission. So this is a specific
[5714.32s -> 5719.20s]  issue. You mentioned here, we've spent a lot of time on these. They're very, very
[5720.16s -> 5725.52s]  critical for everybody doing subdivisions and we benchmark with other councils and we've had a
[5725.52s -> 5731.52s]  lot of times I'm really quite confident at what we're doing is fair and reasonable to be to be
[5731.52s -> 5737.84s]  fit. Okay. Clear your head. And yeah, look, when I read the full submission, actually it sounded
[5737.84s -> 5744.88s]  like he was a bit to be desired in the process that I think early discussions were started and
[5744.88s -> 5752.80s]  indicated likely DC levels. And then these had increased by 300% or something. And then it all
[5752.80s -> 5759.44s]  depended on the catchment of the various services and things like that. And so I don't have a problem
[5759.44s -> 5767.20s]  with the actual staff comments and not response. But it is a signal that we had to watch the
[5767.20s -> 5772.40s]  process to make sure that we're not really alienating our developers and things like, I'm sure
[5772.40s -> 5778.96s]  that I like the staff that I see working, you know, that I know they're completely dedicated and
[5778.96s -> 5784.56s]  know what they're talking about about that they do. But it's just, you know, this kind of submission
[5784.56s -> 5789.84s]  just shows that we've got to be really careful to make sure that that sort of professional
[5789.84s -> 5797.68s]  relationship that we're trying to maintain with our developers is, yeah, it is protected and
[5797.84s -> 5806.56s]  you keep it at the highest possible level, you know, and good heart. Yeah, good observation
[5806.56s -> 5811.44s]  clear. Any other comments? Because I think I get the sense where all comfortable with the recommendation
[5811.44s -> 5815.44s]  there is appearing in the end of the bottom of that page that we write. Yeah, matter of map
[5815.44s -> 5821.12s]  you can I just say, you know, you get a consent to do a subdivision and the DCs at the time
[5821.84s -> 5827.20s]  what they are. But there's a lag time before that takes place and, you know, what's been
[5827.20s -> 5831.52s]  happening in the last three or four years we've had a tremendous amount of work go on and we have
[5831.52s -> 5836.80s]  faced everybody has faced increased charges and all sorts of things from quite the cobbets that
[5836.80s -> 5841.76s]  are to see or whatever. And then they just continue to review, I think, and these people need to
[5841.76s -> 5848.96s]  realize if they have a subdivision that's had a time need or they running into a difficult non-flat
[5848.96s -> 5855.12s]  or a wet area or whatever. In Dolby's and variations and I think it's hard to judge every
[5855.12s -> 5861.20s]  development contribution on every site. Mm-hmm. Yeah, nice. Thank you. Thank you, Vikram.
[5862.08s -> 5869.28s]  Gary. Thank you, Madam Chair. So the development contributions are generally linked to the
[5869.28s -> 5874.56s]  structure things that we've approved and they're capital withdrawing in a long time plan. Now we're
[5874.56s -> 5879.60s]  absolutely accept that from time to time there will be development that's at our worth all of
[5879.60s -> 5884.56s]  those criteria. And that's why we have those development agreements that we've structured and
[5884.56s -> 5891.92s]  Richard, I say Richard, that's as just a ride. We're we're we come to an agreement on a fair and equitable
[5891.92s -> 5897.68s]  payment from the developer to provide all of the infrastructure. So generally these things for
[5897.68s -> 5903.20s]  the really large complex subdivisions are structured by agreement and there's a lot of negotiation
[5903.20s -> 5906.80s]  goes on in that process, but perhaps Richard you might want to comment further on that.
[5909.36s -> 5921.12s]  I'm pretty mad, I'm sorry. I'm sorry Richard. I can't hear my, the only one or is that everybody's
[5921.12s -> 5926.56s]  experience. I can't hear. I'm sorry, is that Peter? Oh that's much better. Thank you Richard. Yeah.
[5926.56s -> 5934.48s]  Well I'll sort of act myself. Excuse the view. And I guess what I have done this particular
[5934.48s -> 5942.64s]  instance was that the developers of the they seize charge of four before the 2016 policy payment
[5942.64s -> 5950.48s]  device. So we're talking about quite a while back in and off of things. So that was I think part of
[5950.48s -> 5956.64s]  the issue. But as you saw in the response here, I've offered to work with them and come up with
[5956.64s -> 5962.96s]  the solution. This is a mission was a bit of a surprise and based on all the discussions we've
[5962.96s -> 5968.64s]  had. So I think there might have been a bit of a side issue that triggered this route within a
[5968.64s -> 5976.72s]  direct one. So we'll continue the discussion in as councilor Sophia made a point. It's really
[5976.72s -> 5980.40s]  important that we have good relationships with the developers. Let's something that we encourage
[5980.40s -> 5987.92s]  and work on all the time. Yeah, it's crucial part of a district grave in a successful sort of plan,
[5987.92s -> 5994.32s]  isn't it? Any other comments? No. So on that basis I assume we're comfortable with that
[5994.32s -> 6000.00s]  recommendation is appearing at the bottom of that page. And then we can move on to the final submission
[6000.00s -> 6006.40s]  and the section and being 30.3, which is from the Cambridge Community Board and respect of
[6006.40s -> 6012.80s]  either the removal of fees for books. Have we any comments and discussion on that?
[6016.00s -> 6023.04s]  Clear? Yeah, like do me the comment when Sue Milner talked to us yesterday that she's been
[6024.00s -> 6029.84s]  asking for this to happen the many years and she likes the point that with the only council
[6029.84s -> 6036.96s]  that charges for library books like this. And I really hear what's in the saying that we can't
[6036.96s -> 6044.00s]  afford to full-gull that, even you, however, I think we should have a transition plan or something.
[6044.00s -> 6050.96s]  So we never got to be able to come up with an extra $75,000 in one hit. But is there a way that we can
[6050.96s -> 6059.76s]  put in place of plan so that over a period of years we could move towards achieving free access
[6059.76s -> 6070.00s]  to our libraries? Through you, through you Madam Chair, I suppose free access and I keep
[6070.00s -> 6076.16s]  banging on about free access. It just means ratepayers are paying for it. Someone else is paying
[6076.16s -> 6083.44s]  for that free access. And I suppose the point that there's always been made is that it's a fairly
[6083.44s -> 6091.60s]  small charge and it does actually represent the, I suppose a payment for the people who use the
[6091.60s -> 6099.28s]  library more than they use sports grounds or anything else. So it is only a minor contribution in the
[6099.28s -> 6107.76s]  overall cost of the libraries. But it also has the, I suppose the aspect that it does
[6108.72s -> 6114.32s]  limit the number of books people take out. I was around when this was introduced and
[6114.32s -> 6121.20s]  people were taking out astronomical numbers of books that they couldn't possibly read in the,
[6121.20s -> 6127.36s]  in the week or fortnight that they had them out for, take them out just on the off chance, I would read
[6127.36s -> 6135.76s]  them. So it was a sort of a managing or rationing that resource if you like in a very small way.
[6135.76s -> 6141.84s]  But I suppose I get to the principle that if people are using the library for that recreational
[6141.84s -> 6148.24s]  purposes, then they should pay a contribution, although it's small, if it's for education purposes,
[6148.24s -> 6156.96s]  we accept there's a public good component. So at some point it's, if we don't want to charge
[6156.96s -> 6162.32s]  for the books, then the extent, if we're going to keep the rates the same, the level of services
[6162.40s -> 6169.68s]  got to drop. Either that or we come up with a commercial arm of a library that does charge for
[6169.68s -> 6179.12s]  those first release type books that Sue was talking about yesterday and rather than have the
[6179.12s -> 6184.24s]  system that we've got now, we introduce some other system of charging to generate that level of
[6184.24s -> 6190.80s]  revenue, look on on surprise, you know, knowledge that we are probably one of the only
[6192.40s -> 6197.92s]  councils in the country making these charges, but maybe some of the other
[6197.92s -> 6201.52s]  councils should follow S, they're early, rather than the other way around.
[6204.48s -> 6207.84s]  I mean, I just, I mean, I've been back, I've been Hazel.
[6207.84s -> 6212.56s]  Yeah, so I mean, it'd be interesting to understand how other councils
[6212.56s -> 6218.40s]  manage it. Yeah, so like I could see is in the response that there will be a business case about it.
[6219.52s -> 6223.60s]  I think it would be helpful to see how other councils that don't
[6224.24s -> 6226.16s]  leave with these charges, how they manage it.
[6228.56s -> 6239.20s]  So, and just on the point of clarification, the submission is for, we would lose 56 or
[6239.20s -> 6244.72s]  nearly 57,000 dollars worth of revenue, but my understanding is their revenue from those
[6244.72s -> 6252.48s]  libraries, library boxes around about 170 something. So, I don't know whether the kids got their
[6252.48s -> 6257.84s]  figure in hand, whether he can tell us exactly what we would lose if we wipe those charges.
[6259.84s -> 6264.00s]  Yes, I believe. Is your arm you quoted the figure that I told you, you said,
[6264.00s -> 6269.68s]  I believe it was 176,000 dollars of library revenue we get. I don't know if you've still got
[6269.68s -> 6275.20s]  it. Or if I find the finance team can help out, but I think it was, it was in their order,
[6276.00s -> 6281.28s]  the amount of our library revenue. I have Sally here, who's known, say something.
[6281.28s -> 6288.40s]  Are you said as correct? We do have other charges, so we charge for magazines, for DVDs, etc.
[6288.40s -> 6295.68s]  So, the 56,000 is based on the cost for adult books, which had charged out at 56 for book.
[6296.48s -> 6298.80s]  So, that's where the figure has come from.
[6300.32s -> 6303.36s]  And Sally, is that across the whole district, not just Cambridge?
[6303.76s -> 6314.40s]  That's across the whole district, yes. So, obviously, if that was waived, then that would be the
[6314.40s -> 6320.08s]  difference that we would need to find in revenue. The unfortunate thing, in terms of discussions
[6320.08s -> 6328.24s]  that we're head used today, our system can't give us information on the releases or the issues
[6328.24s -> 6335.52s]  that we have based on publication date of books. So, we're not able to give you a figure that,
[6335.52s -> 6341.92s]  for example, if we did a charge for recent releases, it would say 12 to 18 months old. We can't
[6341.92s -> 6345.60s]  actually give you a figure of what that would be from a revenue perspective.
[6347.20s -> 6350.24s]  Okay, thanks for that, Sally. And Gary, come to me.
[6351.52s -> 6356.48s]  Sorry, it's through the chair. And the last year, the library revenue was 176,000.
[6359.92s -> 6365.92s]  Gary, you were, again, if the councils have a mind to review, the fees and charges for libraries,
[6365.92s -> 6370.48s]  we can do that in line with our revenue finance policy through the LTP process.
[6370.80s -> 6377.04s]  What I'd like to do is circulate your copy of a paper that, why now I'm prepared as part of
[6377.04s -> 6386.08s]  as masters degree that looked at WIPAS charging policy and respective library books and depth.
[6386.80s -> 6392.56s]  And it gives you the justification for a public policy scene. So, we'll circulate there.
[6392.56s -> 6397.60s]  So, you're well informed and then you can provide us direction on whether you want us to review
[6397.60s -> 6400.88s]  the fees and charges through this LTP process as an extra month.
[6402.08s -> 6406.00s]  That'd be great. Thanks, Gary. Seems a sensible way forward. Marcus, did you have a coming to
[6406.00s -> 6411.12s]  make a question? Yeah, I think that's great, Gary. We can do that then. I'd also like to actually
[6411.12s -> 6416.24s]  hear from the frontline staff about what they think of the policy of charging for the books and
[6416.24s -> 6422.32s]  what impacts does have on their communities because they're the ones that they talk to and see
[6422.32s -> 6426.56s]  the effects of the people who can't afford to read and things and it would be actually quite good to
[6426.56s -> 6435.68s]  hear from you. Yeah, Mike. Yeah, just to back up what Gary and Marcus have just said too.
[6435.68s -> 6439.92s]  So, would that then mean the recommendation we could change that that we are going to look at
[6439.92s -> 6444.96s]  this and review this? I think that would be fear and reasonable and also again about that continuous
[6444.96s -> 6450.96s]  improvement is Marcus has picked up those frontline staff may have other ideas because they
[6450.96s -> 6456.48s]  put a network to about how we can increase revenue in other areas. And also moving forward
[6456.48s -> 6461.12s]  if we look at this over a five or ten years strategy that library may not always be in its current
[6462.40s -> 6465.84s]  current size, et cetera, et cetera. There may be other things that we staff have in the
[6465.84s -> 6471.04s]  pipeline that could generate revenue because the other thing we're totally the community board
[6471.04s -> 6477.36s]  a few years ago is a cost $7 or something to take at a book and we recruit 50 cents that seems
[6478.40s -> 6484.40s]  50 cents green does point one of a percent of a rate and if you throw a lens over this
[6484.40s -> 6487.60s]  surely we can put some revenue somewhere within the lower realisation.
[6489.84s -> 6494.88s]  Hey, so did you have a question or a comment? Well, not really a question, but but you know,
[6494.88s -> 6502.00s]  I sometimes wonder where these statements come from because we have it book readers. The
[6502.00s -> 6506.96s]  our libraries are wonderful places. They get in the latest books as quick as you can.
[6506.96s -> 6512.24s]  You've only got to ask them if the book isn't there and they'll have it for you within a couple of days.
[6512.48s -> 6520.24s]  And I think the service there, what we get for our 50 cents or whatever is minimal and certainly
[6520.24s -> 6527.12s]  we can't afford to go and buy the books, the only probably the best avenue for any any of the
[6527.12s -> 6532.32s]  book lovers. And that's that's many of your senior citizens who'd much rather read a book than
[6532.32s -> 6541.20s]  watch some of the nonsense on TV. And so look, I've been in contact with many many of our senior
[6541.28s -> 6548.88s]  citizens over this. And they think it's they love it. And when you go into the library,
[6548.88s -> 6556.56s]  there's lines of people with more than one or two books, but you're quite right that we
[6556.56s -> 6562.16s]  tend to get as we read it and get it back to the library. I think it's an amazing service
[6562.16s -> 6569.12s]  for which I don't mind paying because it's something that I enjoy very much and it's my
[6569.12s -> 6578.48s]  relaxation time. So I'm in favor of just leaving things as they are because I know that
[6578.48s -> 6583.20s]  I know that there's a huge sector of our community and I haven't met anybody yet.
[6584.24s -> 6591.52s]  I know a woman with seven kids who goes there every fortnight to get the books because she believes
[6591.52s -> 6598.16s]  in that and she doesn't she doesn't mind paying for it. That's part of their management of their
[6598.16s -> 6607.68s]  funds. And so I don't want to get a big issue out of this because I don't think that I think
[6607.68s -> 6614.96s]  maybe if the one or two that complain about it are heard, but those of us who enjoy it don't,
[6614.96s -> 6619.92s]  then I think we've got to stick with the revenue that we get from it, but we can actually get
[6619.92s -> 6626.24s]  better books, you know, as libraries to run better. So yeah, let's just life in here.
[6626.32s -> 6631.76s]  Thank you, Hazel. Graham, did you have something? Yeah, I just wanted to bear a godpazel and it was
[6631.76s -> 6636.16s]  the top of it, top of it, top of interest in illicit yesterday. There was leaders to the editor
[6636.16s -> 6640.88s]  in the papers saying that it was good value. So it wasn't a pro thorough of people coming out of
[6640.88s -> 6645.60s]  their field saying, yeah, you know, get rid of this fee. The other thing we needed to note was that
[6645.60s -> 6649.92s]  and Sue talked about this, they haven't, it's not that they don't charge at all the other
[6649.92s -> 6654.72s]  large reason, you know, they have set fees for new additions, which, you know, they might charge
[6654.72s -> 6659.04s]  two or three bucks. So they're, it's not free free if you know what I mean, they're just a different
[6659.04s -> 6664.80s]  form of charging. Yeah, and we don't have to go and buy our own books, that's a big,
[6665.52s -> 6668.40s]  good size. I think we should leave the recommendation, is it as to be honest?
[6668.40s -> 6671.84s]  Yeah, you happy with the recommendation as it is, or did we want to make some amendment
[6671.84s -> 6678.24s]  making reference to the issues raised by Gary in terms of the policy review and during the LTP process?
[6678.32s -> 6681.84s]  Well, I wouldn't mind reading the policy review, but I say, leave it as it is.
[6684.08s -> 6692.48s]  I agree. Have I got any, I mean, I think it's a favour of what Mike and Mike has said about
[6692.48s -> 6699.20s]  getting some feedback, like doing a review, getting a feedback from the frontline staff and others
[6699.20s -> 6704.48s]  are the councils about how they manage it and whether or not they might be a much better approach
[6704.56s -> 6710.56s]  where we will achieve the outcomes we want and improve the access here for our communities.
[6711.60s -> 6716.96s]  So I don't want to leave things as it is. You don't, I mean, the recommendation,
[6717.76s -> 6721.28s]  how would you prefer it be worded then clear? Have you any suggestions?
[6722.56s -> 6727.20s]  Well, I thought the Hazel was saying not to go for the business case, but just to leave it
[6727.20s -> 6733.04s]  at the service quiet, that it was good family-less instead. Yeah, as a favour of the business case,
[6733.04s -> 6740.32s]  and extending it to include feedback from frontline library staff and other councils to
[6740.32s -> 6747.20s]  understand the funding models and other approaches to gain moving you while improving access.
[6748.16s -> 6753.84s]  Okay, well, do we need to um, our ultimate, that recommendation to record that and just,
[6753.84s -> 6757.92s]  at all, I don't, I wouldn't think that we need to. I mean, it says in terms of the staff,
[6757.92s -> 6762.72s]  I mean, this is a business case to develop a strategic plan for why our district council's library
[6762.72s -> 6768.72s]  service has been included for consideration in the 21 31 LTP process. You're just saying that you
[6768.72s -> 6774.96s]  want to include in that staff comment that that will also include consultation or inclusion of
[6774.96s -> 6780.24s]  frontline staff perspective and canvassing other jurisdictions, is that what just suggests in clear?
[6781.04s -> 6786.32s]  Well, yes, but your question was, will we happy with what Hazel was suggesting
[6786.40s -> 6792.40s]  we're not doing that? Oh, and I'm quite happy to have that added on to it. Let's do it
[6792.40s -> 6798.96s]  do it as well, but but I also wanted to say that, you know, we're happy with things as they are,
[6798.96s -> 6809.12s]  but I have no objection to um, accepting the review, yeah? Okay. So I think I think the,
[6809.12s -> 6814.40s]  of what's in the staff recommendation is what everyone is agreeing with. Yeah, I see that.
[6815.36s -> 6820.00s]  So we're comfortable with the recommendation as it sets. Excellent. Okay. We're here and we're
[6820.00s -> 6828.16s]  happy to deal with that one in that's good. Now, um, so, Jenny, are you on a position and
[6828.16s -> 6833.68s]  same and a position to be able to provide us with that um, table, if you like, of what our
[6833.68s -> 6837.36s]  amendments were regarding those recommendations, what do you need a few more minutes because we
[6837.36s -> 6843.60s]  couldn't break for five if we might have got a question. I was really close with someone. I was
[6843.60s -> 6848.32s]  when they clarified that last semester we talked about under recommendation, the last very last
[6848.32s -> 6852.32s]  bit of it. I understand a bit of above it, but it's canceling notes to submit us request,
[6852.32s -> 6861.60s]  but declines to reduce low-brilleing fees and charges. So does that still make seats and
[6861.60s -> 6868.40s]  terms of um, reviewing this as part of a 2021, you know, like a long-term clean application,
[6868.40s -> 6872.72s]  because it's not so much about not reducing fees. It's about looking at the business.
[6873.36s -> 6877.60s]  It's fair looking at the business. You may like to make the more money else by looking at the
[6877.60s -> 6882.24s]  business. Do I just say, why do we focus? It's the whole, I'll run in a lot of proof.
[6883.60s -> 6889.28s]  Yeah, I think the the point is that the submission relates to this annual plan, um, and
[6889.28s -> 6896.88s]  the, um, the, um, staff comments relate to work going forward in the LTP. So the recommendation
[6896.88s -> 6903.36s]  and response to the specific submission about this annual plan, it's, it's actually the response
[6903.36s -> 6915.92s]  is correct. Yeah. Okay. So Susan, but just on it, we're not, well, I'll make the assumption
[6915.92s -> 6921.52s]  that what the staff comments say are actually as what the response is sent to the submitter.
[6922.48s -> 6929.76s]  But I think what Mike's trying to clarify is that, um, is the start, if there's a response
[6929.76s -> 6933.84s]  that the submitting, it's just what the recommendation is, which is, we've known you also mission
[6933.84s -> 6938.08s]  that we're declining to do anything. You know, it'd be much better if all of the comments that
[6938.08s -> 6943.36s]  in the start comments were also given to the submitter. Graham would be able to answer that for me.
[6943.36s -> 6950.32s]  I'm sure more, obviously. Yeah. The staff comments as we've published our in the public documents,
[6950.48s -> 6957.44s]  it's what we're reading now. In terms of what we send to the submitter at the end of the
[6957.44s -> 6963.92s]  whole annual plan process once we've adopted it will be based on those comments. Um, because obviously
[6963.92s -> 6970.64s]  things may just move forward with any of the comments or anything that's made during the later stages
[6970.64s -> 6977.36s]  of the annual plan. Plus, of course, um, we don't know what the final outcome of the annual plan
[6977.44s -> 6984.08s]  is going to be yet because we've not gone through those stages. So, um, that's all taken into account
[6984.08s -> 6990.40s]  and wrapped up in the response we finally provide to them. But obviously based on the staff
[6990.40s -> 6997.20s]  comments, we, uh, we've got already and the recommendation that you provide or the decision you make
[6997.20s -> 7003.36s]  rather. Thank you, Kirstie. Um, through the momentum, she just added to that. We very much want to
[7003.36s -> 7010.24s]  adopt a customer focused approach and providing responses to the submission process. So to ensure that
[7010.24s -> 7015.68s]  we provide as much information as possible. Um, so as Graham said, we will be approaching those
[7015.68s -> 7021.28s]  on a case-by-case basis, um, having consideration to the staff comments, the recommendation,
[7021.28s -> 7026.24s]  and anything that changes in between. Yeah, no, that makes sense. Thanks for clarifying that.
[7027.12s -> 7034.40s]  So I can I assume we're happy with that that last measure. Good. And so now, Jenny, where we
[7036.88s -> 7043.28s]  do we have a scream or some? Yeah, I'm happy with this great deal. What we've got for now. Okay,
[7043.36s -> 7046.88s]  yes, please, that'll be helpful.
[7062.88s -> 7063.52s]  Okay.
[7063.52s -> 7076.56s]  Okay, so here we have the first three submissions at no change as per our discussions.
[7077.92s -> 7085.36s]  10.9, we were deferring that's relating to, um, developer's contributions, 11.1,
[7085.36s -> 7090.48s]  that was the Coastal submission. So submission point noted opportunities for efficiencies are
[7090.48s -> 7095.44s]  considered as they arise, and we will work with applicants on a case-by-case basis. I think that's a
[7095.44s -> 7104.24s]  good improvement. Uh, 11.2, um, relates to hourly rates. So the response we've put there is
[7104.24s -> 7108.72s]  every three years we review our revenue and financial policies, including our overhead models,
[7108.72s -> 7112.96s]  as part of the LTP process, and our fees and charges will be reviewed as part of the development
[7112.96s -> 7119.76s]  of the 2131 LTP over the next 12 months. I think that's a much better response. Thank you.
[7119.76s -> 7126.08s]  And then clauses, points, 11.3, point, and point four, remain unchanged, 18.1,
[7126.08s -> 7137.52s]  20.3 unchanged, and then the, that's us, yeah, that's all of that. So we're all comfortable with those
[7137.52s -> 7144.48s]  changes. Yep. Excellent. Great. Now, should we, quickly, was through the unassigned ones,
[7144.56s -> 7148.40s]  just because of the last page on this particular document on page 48,
[7149.60s -> 7153.84s]  to squeeze them away, and I don't know whether people would like to have a quick break or not,
[7153.84s -> 7159.36s]  we've been at it for a while. But through the chair, these are just two points that didn't
[7159.36s -> 7165.04s]  quite seem to fit into anywhere else. And actually I'll understand looking at them. Yeah.
[7166.72s -> 7171.76s]  Now, does it, does anybody have a difficulty with either of the responses made to, on those two
[7171.76s -> 7179.52s]  particular? I was to deal with 39.1, it was just a support of the, by the two, which
[7179.52s -> 7183.68s]  a community board for Council, which was much appreciated. So I'm assuming we're all comfortable
[7183.68s -> 7189.12s]  with that response. And then the last one was in response to a submission that trends that
[7190.72s -> 7195.44s]  sort of traverse a whole lot of issues, but didn't seek any particular remedy or
[7196.40s -> 7203.60s]  response in any particular way. So are we comfortable with that recommendation? Yeah. Andrew.
[7205.52s -> 7211.04s]  Yeah. Does this submit, or I think, was asking for a heavy traffic to be devuted from
[7211.76s -> 7216.32s]  Protestant and street and flagred? And I, I take a, that's not really a possibility.
[7217.44s -> 7222.24s]  Yeah. I don't, I don't know that that is the one. No, I don't think that this, this submit
[7222.24s -> 7232.72s]  it actually was the person who would have kicked us off yesterday. Yeah. But didn't, didn't join the meeting.
[7234.00s -> 7240.16s]  But I, I don't think this is, I think the person that was talking about flat road was the
[7240.16s -> 7250.80s]  submitter who had to withdraw from yesterday afternoon's hearing. So, and it has, I hope that it's
[7250.80s -> 7256.72s]  coming up somewhere because I don't quite agree with Andrews, but we just had a very nasty
[7256.72s -> 7263.60s]  accident down there this week. Can I just ask you for a minute? Because it's actually not relevant
[7263.60s -> 7268.88s]  to this particular, but there's the point, but it will come up. Yeah, we're, it comes up. I don't
[7268.88s -> 7274.08s]  will come up. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we are comfortable with those, that recommendation that
[7274.08s -> 7278.64s]  she's not, no specific remedies, so no, so the recommendation is just to thank her. Yeah,
[7278.64s -> 7282.24s]  we're comfortable with that. Excellent. Yeah. Okay. So we can square those two away. Now,
[7282.24s -> 7286.64s]  do people want a comfort stop or a wee break or are they happy to soldier on?
[7288.48s -> 7290.72s]  Solder on. Solder on. Okay.
[7291.92s -> 7297.84s]  Gosh, we're two now then. So we've dealt with, obviously, facing charges in an assigned
[7297.84s -> 7305.36s]  measure. Thanks, probably appropriate to shoot up back up again to either the three big ones,
[7305.36s -> 7311.68s]  the financial issues so that we can square them away or defer them. If we comfortable with that,
[7312.96s -> 7317.60s]  we could take the ball by the horns and start with rats, if we like, right, the beginning of the
[7317.60s -> 7327.28s]  document. Okay. I think on this, we'll make a lot of progress quite quickly, because some of them
[7327.36s -> 7334.72s]  are very similar. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So three point one. Obviously, we're on page three
[7334.72s -> 7341.36s]  of appendix three for those who, I'm sure we were, they were at the Federated Farmers submission
[7341.36s -> 7346.16s]  around rats and the recommendation is that we've knowledge the submission and endorse the staff
[7346.16s -> 7353.44s]  comments. And the staff comments is the, I don't want to use the word standard, but it's a very
[7353.52s -> 7358.16s]  well-worded and repeated response to a lot of the questions around our rates. And I think it's
[7358.16s -> 7366.40s]  pretty comprehensive and explain, position, we're in quite well. So on the assumption that we're happy
[7366.40s -> 7377.92s]  with that, that response, we can move on to the next one. Yeah. If everybody's very quiet.
[7378.16s -> 7384.00s]  Yeah. I'm just switching, switching for where you are. Okay. We're on page three,
[7384.00s -> 7388.72s]  hazel, right at the beginning. All right. Yeah. Right at the beginning. Yeah. So we're doing them
[7388.72s -> 7394.24s]  by, by topic and rites as the topic we're on now. Yep. So we've just dealt with that Federated
[7394.24s -> 7403.60s]  Farmers submission. And then the next one is the property council of New Zealand. Very, very similar
[7404.32s -> 7410.48s]  and in vain, except that we've added the staff response there as that we've also agreed that
[7410.48s -> 7414.72s]  rat players will have longer to pay there. 2021 rates without peanut penalties, we've
[7414.72s -> 7419.20s]  upset a payment arrangements with their arrangements to sit in place few months ago. And we'll
[7419.20s -> 7425.04s]  clear out, so long as they're clear those rates. So it gives them those prolonged timeframes.
[7425.04s -> 7431.04s]  So just that additional staff comment to the, to the standard well-worded response. And so
[7431.04s -> 7447.04s]  there's our recommendation and we're comfortable with that. Yep. The next one. 6.1. Reduction and
[7447.04s -> 7451.52s]  all rites apart from the usual rate holiday. Are you going to help us with the rates holiday
[7451.52s -> 7456.96s]  with pensioners and we're really struggling? Would anybody like to make some comments and
[7456.96s -> 7467.36s]  respect of this submission? So those are not just probably just that off. And look,
[7468.40s -> 7474.00s]  as cheap as we can keep the rates, the better we all want to see that. But we've got a pay for
[7474.00s -> 7483.60s]  our level of service. So in this particular case, those people that are out on fixed incomes are
[7483.68s -> 7490.16s]  probably insecure income to better off than a lot of people that are still likely to become unemployed.
[7490.16s -> 7500.56s]  So I acknowledge that the retirement income is not not significant in terms of having a lot of
[7500.56s -> 7506.88s]  freeboard. But the situation hasn't changed for people on pensions, if you like it, in this
[7506.88s -> 7514.72s]  COVID situation. So look, I acknowledge that it's a struggle for people, but the rates are
[7514.72s -> 7521.84s]  good value for money and we do need to keep the rating level up. Thanks, Jim.
[7523.20s -> 7525.60s]  Yeah. Hey, how are you? Did you have any feedback? No, clear.
[7527.44s -> 7534.08s]  A bit of a bit of a bit of a bit in between a rates holiday and waving rates. You know, like,
[7534.16s -> 7539.60s]  if you get a rates holiday, you've still got to pay them. And it may well be that they might be
[7539.60s -> 7543.92s]  additional charges or something. I don't know, like it's a bit like a mortgage holiday, you know,
[7543.92s -> 7547.84s]  it doesn't mean you don't have to pay it in, you might like it extra interest at the end of
[7547.84s -> 7553.60s]  that. So I'm really happy with the response, actually. It really sets out what the arrangements are
[7553.60s -> 7559.28s]  if people are in, and you know, struggling to meet the payments right now. Yeah. And the
[7559.28s -> 7565.28s]  addresses, Jim's, you know, mantra that we've got to pay for these services somehow. Yeah.
[7566.32s -> 7569.60s]  Okay, thank you. We've got anything further on that, or are we quite comfortable with that?
[7570.24s -> 7576.80s]  Oh, so, Greg, look, can I make a comment? Can we just make sure that when a reply goes back
[7576.80s -> 7583.60s]  to the submitter, they are aware of the rates remission through Council for about $635.
[7583.60s -> 7587.60s]  Yeah. See if that picked up or they've missed it? I know that we send it out in our rates,
[7587.60s -> 7592.24s]  but it would be very, very good to have these people know what is available through Council on
[7592.24s -> 7596.16s]  the Government subsidy. That's all. Yeah, look, I think that's a really good point, Graham.
[7596.16s -> 7600.40s]  There may be people who probably had never even contemplated or thought about the need to even apply
[7600.40s -> 7605.68s]  for the past. So you just need to know where to go, just a little bit of a direction on where to go.
[7605.68s -> 7610.72s]  Yeah. Now, good point. Good point. Okay. So we're happy with that recommendation. That means we'll
[7610.72s -> 7616.24s]  move on to the next one. 6.1. Reduction and all rates apart from the usual rate holiday, you're going
[7616.24s -> 7620.64s]  to help with the rates holiday. Oh, is that the same one? No, sorry. I'm repeating myself.
[7621.84s -> 7625.76s]  I'm just 17.1. I'm not saying so. Even point one. No rate increases. And they're current
[7625.76s -> 7630.40s]  climate where you strongly urge all Council to consider no increases for the next 12 months
[7630.40s -> 7636.32s]  at a minimum. Again, we have the staff response as worded earlier and the recommendations
[7636.32s -> 7640.32s]  Council of Knowledgeists of submission and endorses staff comments. Do we have any further
[7640.32s -> 7645.52s]  discussion on there? No. No, not for now. We hope you would bet. Happy with it.
[7646.40s -> 7651.68s]  Yeah, one thought. Next one, 7.2. Council should consider rate remissions or rate
[7651.68s -> 7656.64s]  rebates for businesses adversely affected by COVID and including delay rate and so on. Again,
[7656.64s -> 7662.56s]  same response and sitting out, same response is the early one in terms of the relief
[7662.56s -> 7668.32s]  put in place by Council and respective timeframes and agreements to pay. So the recommendation
[7668.32s -> 7673.60s]  near is Council asks us a metaphor for raising their concerns and but no further action.
[7673.60s -> 7682.48s]  We're happy with that. Yep. Great. Moving on to the next one. 8.1. Similar vein and net. It is
[7682.48s -> 7688.40s]  no rates increased. Do you job? We've got this one. We would have response there from staff
[7688.40s -> 7692.72s]  and the recommendation that Council acknowledges for submissions and endorses. We're comfortable
[7692.72s -> 7699.44s]  with that response at this point. Yep. It's okay. Looking over the page, so we're now in page six.
[7701.44s -> 7710.48s]  9.1. A very similar and flavor as well and seeking a zero-pistent rates freeze. The same
[7710.48s -> 7715.36s]  response we've given in terms of that worded response from staff and we acknowledge that submission
[7715.36s -> 7721.44s]  and endorse the staff's comments. We're comfortable with that. Yep. Great. Next one.
[7722.32s -> 7728.40s]  7. A good notion again delaying any rates increases and this particular one
[7729.76s -> 7735.60s]  there's been an additional comment in the staff comments that we've commenced community engagement
[7735.60s -> 7742.96s]  for the RTP and that further opportunities for community input and that respect to that submission.
[7742.96s -> 7747.12s]  So again, the recommendation is that we acknowledge the submission and endorse the staff's response.
[7747.84s -> 7756.08s]  Yep. Anybody? No. No, but it's like fantastic. Same to in the page. 10.2.
[7757.52s -> 7762.48s]  Rates relief or rate opposite options such as waving like fees allowing for delayed rates
[7762.48s -> 7766.40s]  this moment for all. Again, I think it's been pretty well covered in some of the earliest submissions
[7766.40s -> 7770.56s]  and we were comfortable with the responses. So I assume in low of anybody waving their hands
[7770.56s -> 7773.36s]  around were comfortable with the response of the year and the recommendation.
[7773.84s -> 7783.84s]  Match the same as 12.1 and moving us on the into 19.10.
[7786.32s -> 7793.04s]  So this is the community boards, two-minute community boards submission asking council to
[7793.04s -> 7796.80s]  lobby central government to heavily distillation change to enable targeted rates relief to those in
[7796.80s -> 7802.72s]  our community. I suspect this actually I do know that this was worded or collated before we actually
[7802.72s -> 7811.36s]  meet and made any relief available in the earlier throws of COVID. So again, I think the
[7811.36s -> 7817.52s]  response was provided and the recommendation of appropriate. I would assume we're happy with that.
[7818.40s -> 7825.44s]  Fine with that. Excellent. So that brings us on that's the end of that section.
[7826.16s -> 7833.76s]  Well, I might not have a full house of everyone being accepting the recommendations. Is that correct, Jenny?
[7838.24s -> 7845.28s]  Jenny is there. I hope that is a full house of tech too. We don't. We deserve a few extra
[7845.28s -> 7851.68s]  comments but we put on but yes, we don't. Interesting. Wonderful. Okay, well it's now um they're
[7851.68s -> 7857.84s]  live in 15. I wondered if people would have just soldering on. Yep, okay. Right, we'll move
[7857.84s -> 7865.20s]  chronologically on the into budgets. So somewhat similar I guess in terms of concern about
[7866.00s -> 7871.84s]  spending. So the first one there is 10.6. Consider taking on more debt, especially for
[7871.84s -> 7876.56s]  capitalists in it to ensure key infrastructure projects continue to progress in order to maintain
[7876.56s -> 7882.00s]  the work process needed long to coming up from a different angle. You'll see the response there
[7882.00s -> 7886.80s]  again and that we acknowledge the submission and the staff recommendations. Has anybody got a
[7886.80s -> 7889.92s]  comment on that one? It's sort of a little bit different in terms of its submission, but
[7891.68s -> 7895.52s]  no, no comments. I'll take it with a countable with that. I'll just go ahead.
[7895.52s -> 7901.92s]  You can still remember my me what submission that was. Who that was from? 10.6 is um hold on.
[7902.80s -> 7906.72s]  They're just a little bit invisible the way that we're sort of going through them. I just want to
[7906.72s -> 7911.52s]  make sure. Yeah, yeah, I've been looking at the table of contents by submit a number, which is
[7911.52s -> 7917.60s]  on a Pindex one. So that was 10. So that was uh the property council work at a branch. Was it one?
[7917.60s -> 7922.64s]  Okay, just wanted to check. Thank you. Yeah, if submit a numbering is correct, which I believe it should
[7922.64s -> 7929.04s]  be so. There was just copied from one document into the next. So that it should be consistent.
[7929.76s -> 7933.44s]  Yeah, yeah, I guess the thing is it's a little bit better and a number saved because we're
[7933.44s -> 7938.96s]  done. Yeah, but if you refer back to that index of submit even we've got who they are.
[7938.96s -> 7946.24s]  So you can't be happy with that, let's? Yeah, yeah. So yeah, same, same submitter, obviously this.
[7946.24s -> 7951.76s]  So we're comfortable with that. Yeah, I'll talk about one off. And then the same submitter raises an
[7951.76s -> 7961.04s]  issue in terms of leveraging government's building, the government's building, depreciation policy.
[7963.04s -> 7966.56s]  I can't suggest essentially think them for this submission. Are we comfortable with that?
[7967.92s -> 7974.24s]  King. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, sorry, through the chair. So this one is a lot about
[7974.24s -> 7979.20s]  unusual because um, yeah, because really the government's building depreciation policy. I mean,
[7979.20s -> 7985.20s]  I think that's referring to a recent text break that the government's provided in the depreciation
[7985.20s -> 7991.28s]  space. Of course, some council is not a tax paying entity. So so in some ways, this is really
[7991.28s -> 7997.84s]  not applicable to us. Yeah, you know, we can't we can't be for the government's building depreciation
[7997.84s -> 8004.32s]  policy because we really don't pay tax. So yeah, so so I just suggest a little bit about a
[8004.32s -> 8010.40s]  read word of these and then pick up off that. Okay, I think that makes sense. Can it clarifies
[8010.40s -> 8015.76s]  a little bit more for the submitter? So Jenny and you are able to incorporate that.
[8017.44s -> 8023.52s]  I'm going to put this in. Okay, thank you. I'll just note that we're going to do a wee change there.
[8026.48s -> 8033.52s]  So we'll get people come back to that one. So moving on to 12.2, the general
[8034.48s -> 8040.56s]  submission related to reduced management salaries by 20% or more. Who wants to kick me off on this one?
[8040.56s -> 8045.36s]  Anyone who are we just going to agree with the staff comments and
[8046.96s -> 8053.28s]  and the recommendation there. Yeah, move on. So it's nice. I agree with the, with the comments, but just
[8053.28s -> 8060.72s]  wonder if we, um, when we do finalize this night to June or whenever it is that we actually
[8061.52s -> 8068.88s]  put a line in there that overall salary and consultancy cross costs of decreased by whatever it
[8068.88s -> 8075.76s]  ends up being. Just just to show that we have taken it seriously. We're not picking on individuals.
[8075.76s -> 8081.12s]  We're looking at the whole organization and and we have actually achieved the positive result.
[8082.80s -> 8090.32s]  Yeah, look, I think that's sensible. And yeah, rather than just making a crude
[8090.88s -> 8095.68s]  commitment to a blanket reduction, we've actually really gone through and looked at looked at what
[8095.68s -> 8100.56s]  we've got and fine-tuned and made it more targeted reductions. Yeah, and spaces. I think that's
[8100.56s -> 8108.48s]  sensible. Okay, so on that assumption, can I assume we're happy with the recommendation there?
[8110.80s -> 8120.64s]  Yeah, cool. And then 12.3, a suggestion near that we have a reduction in staff staffing numbers.
[8121.28s -> 8127.68s]  Um, and then obviously the response there, which you're able to read and that the recommendation
[8127.68s -> 8131.92s]  be that we perceive with the determination of the revised annual plan including priorities and budgets.
[8133.12s -> 8136.32s]  We have any discussion on that so we're quite comfortable with the proposals.
[8137.92s -> 8146.72s]  Great. The next one, uh, 12.4, um, this, an interesting, um,
[8147.44s -> 8152.56s]  you know, if you like of the cost of the additional counselor and Cambridge and there's obviously a
[8152.56s -> 8156.96s]  staff comment there at briefing down some of the costings there and the recommendation that we
[8156.96s -> 8161.28s]  acknowledge the submission and provide the information requested above. We can't talk about that.
[8162.64s -> 8171.52s]  Yep, fantastic. The next one, then, as 12.5, this is on page 10, um, council should at least
[8171.60s -> 8175.28s]  a fairly non essential expenditure like museums and so on and so forth.
[8176.56s -> 8182.40s]  Just quite a, well, worded, I thought response there by staff about that balance and I thought
[8182.40s -> 8187.44s]  it was actually really nicely put. So I'm comfortable with the way that that reads, but I've
[8187.44s -> 8196.64s]  been to a discussion on it. It is a fully explanation, which is good. Yeah, yeah, I think it's good.
[8196.64s -> 8204.96s]  Sorry. Susan, could I just stuck back to the previous one in terms of the, again, similar to
[8204.96s -> 8212.48s]  the comment I made previously in terms of, um, the additional, the training costs because that's one
[8212.48s -> 8217.12s]  of the budgets. We're looking at and I don't know what that's been reduced down to, but from a,
[8217.12s -> 8222.48s]  from a council perspective, that was one of the, um, possibilities of saving some, some,
[8222.48s -> 8228.56s]  some money. So, um, I think if we can quantify it, I'm not sure where we got to with it.
[8233.20s -> 8239.12s]  Yeah. Okay. So, did you want to alter that recommendation or not or, or
[8239.12s -> 8245.04s]  a flesh out rather than the staff comments in that space? Yes, maybe. If there has been a savings,
[8246.00s -> 8252.32s]  a significant saving in there, training costs, which we were looking at, um, pulling back on is just
[8252.32s -> 8257.60s]  one means of reducing costs. We should, we should, if it was 50k or something like that,
[8257.60s -> 8264.72s]  it's worth putting in, but we've taken X amount of dollars out of the governance training budget.
[8265.60s -> 8271.20s]  Mm-hmm. Okay. Ken, you have your hand up? Yeah. So, so through the cheer I can't recall the
[8271.20s -> 8276.40s]  figure about yes, there was a significant reduction and, and, and, and training budgets, so we're
[8276.40s -> 8280.32s]  so we could, um, we could easily incorporate the coming to that as wish of a small people.
[8281.76s -> 8286.88s]  Okay. All right. If we could do that, that would be helpful. Deborah, you may do your hand around.
[8290.16s -> 8295.12s]  Yeah. Um, it was 15,000 of training costs that have been saved.
[8296.48s -> 8302.64s]  Sorry, how much was that? Sorry, do you write in the quiet catch that 15,000 of training costs that have
[8302.72s -> 8311.76s]  been saved? Okay. So, are you not worth a mention then? Yeah. Yeah. Well, sorry, sorry,
[8311.76s -> 8316.32s]  through the, um, through the cheer again, is she in the context of this? Um, I,
[8316.32s -> 8321.28s]  actually, I, I thought the number was a bit bigger there, um, but we could also add in the number
[8321.28s -> 8325.76s]  for the current year because I know we killed off, um, you're quite a bit in the current year.
[8325.76s -> 8330.00s]  So, so I think our response could even, even though I appreciate this, this is mean you're playing
[8330.00s -> 8334.80s]  in submission. Um, you, you know, we could indicate that, um, yeah, you know, the, the doubles have reduced
[8334.80s -> 8341.52s]  by so much in the current year and, and so much in the end, please. You, um,
[8341.52s -> 8345.20s]  leave, leave, leave, leave, let's have a look at what the numbers are before we put the
[8345.20s -> 8350.56s]  put the coming together. Okay. So, can, should we just leave that one for now, push it to the side?
[8350.56s -> 8357.12s]  Is that what you're suggesting? Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine with it. Okay.
[8358.00s -> 8365.68s]  All right. So, we've dealt with the 12.5. So, we're over the page on to page 11, then, a submission
[8365.68s -> 8374.00s]  19.1. Um, the service was the tumultuous board of tumultuous community board, I believe, to,
[8374.00s -> 8379.52s]  um, supporting any, um, decision that counts for my mate, mate, in terms of, um, non-essential
[8379.52s -> 8384.72s]  expenditure. Um, again, it was a well-worded response and the recommendation acknowledging the
[8384.72s -> 8389.84s]  submission and endorsing the comments countable with that. Yeah. Excellent. And then,
[8390.72s -> 8397.36s]  21.5. This is Heritage New Zealand submission, I believe. Um, have, have, have,
[8397.36s -> 8403.44s]  anybody that has an issue or a discussion to be had around their, their submission and
[8403.44s -> 8413.76s]  comments and subsequent recommendation? No, nobody. Okay. We, so we're comfortable with that.
[8413.76s -> 8425.76s]  You can take that one off as well. Okay. Moving on then to 22.1. Um, again, a similar, a similar,
[8428.16s -> 8432.88s]  a similar submission by somebody trying to, um, a suggest that we just put hold on everything so
[8432.88s -> 8438.40s]  that the well-worded response there by by staff and in, in, in, in our recommendation. Um,
[8438.40s -> 8442.00s]  we have a suggestion that we acknowledge that submission and endorse those comments that we're
[8442.32s -> 8452.80s]  comfortable with that approach. Yep. Yeah. Okay. And again, as 22.4, the next one is much the same
[8454.72s -> 8461.20s]  and same response that we're happy with there. Okay. Awesome. Great. We are with them through these.
[8462.40s -> 8467.52s]  Right. And the next one, 22.5, that the counts continue to utilize funding mechanisms,
[8467.52s -> 8470.96s]  such as targeted rates, fees and charges to fund services, which have a high level of
[8471.92s -> 8478.56s]  identifiable benefits. So we've suggested we've got a response there about the review mentioned
[8478.56s -> 8483.36s]  earlier by Gary and our recommendation there is that we acknowledge a submission and we'll review
[8483.36s -> 8488.00s]  the request, um, the request is part of LTP policy review process for comfortable with that.
[8489.20s -> 8493.84s]  Yep. Yeah. I think it's pretty good. So that's good.
[8494.48s -> 8501.04s]  20, next one, 22.6 that counts continue to keep the general rate contribution below 60%
[8501.04s -> 8507.60s]  of the total district wide funding. So are we comfortable with our response there that staff have
[8507.60s -> 8514.16s]  um, detailed reports? We're happy with that. Excellent. Yeah. Now, the centers there so we're
[8514.16s -> 8522.32s]  comfortable with the recommendation and also the comments. Thank you. Moving on to submission
[8522.40s -> 8531.68s]  27.4. The suggestion that Brad should be lowered to encourage home ownership in least
[8531.68s -> 8538.48s]  stress and way on wage owners. There's a sort of scale down response to the, um,
[8538.48s -> 8544.64s]  in terms of the comment that we seem to have really had to some of these suggestions there
[8544.64s -> 8549.92s]  and an acknowledgement and the recommendation that the submission be received and there
[8549.92s -> 8558.48s]  concerns for their lower rates and I said, we're happy with that. Yeah. And I think that when we send
[8558.48s -> 8563.20s]  out our rates demand, we must remember that it's not only pensioners that, that complain,
[8563.20s -> 8570.08s]  you know, that need this, but everybody gets that note about the subsidy, don't they? Do they?
[8571.84s -> 8577.68s]  Just, you know, I think it goes out with your rates demand, yes, but I think um, Graham,
[8577.92s -> 8581.68s]  we've made a really good point before that in response to some of these specific
[8581.68s -> 8586.56s]  um, submissions around rates that we remind for them to the rates from a shimp process
[8586.56s -> 8590.72s]  because it might have been something that they hadn't ever contemplated prior. Yeah. Exactly.
[8590.72s -> 8598.96s]  Exactly. Yeah. Okay. Well, so the point there is that it's income related. So that's the
[8598.96s -> 8603.68s]  message we need to get out. It doesn't mean you have to be on a pension if you're on a, yeah,
[8603.84s -> 8611.68s]  in a vet or an unemployment benefit or whatever it is, can you apply to that? Yeah, absolutely.
[8612.32s -> 8616.16s]  Point you. Right. So we're comfortable with that recommendation then.
[8617.68s -> 8629.84s]  So then we can move on to 30.1. Interesting submission there. Yeah. Does anybody want to
[8629.84s -> 8635.20s]  kick me off with any discussion on or suggestions or endorsement of the response or recommendation?
[8636.80s -> 8640.64s]  It's hard to decide when the more for two at a time will arrive.
[8644.00s -> 8649.04s]  Look, I'm comfortable with the with the response that staff have provided there.
[8650.64s -> 8655.12s]  And the recommendation is that the submission is acknowledged and that the submit is referred to the annual
[8655.12s -> 8661.76s]  plan for budget and project details. Yeah. I think that's any points. Yeah, comfortable with that.
[8661.76s -> 8667.04s]  Excellent. So submission number of point number 31.1.
[8670.00s -> 8676.48s]  Let's you might want to speak to this. Not putting yours on or anything, but obviously there's a person with
[8676.48s -> 8681.04s]  a feeling clear view around some of the larger projects in the district, we've provided a response
[8681.04s -> 8685.44s]  back to them there and the recommendation that we acknowledge the submission and endorse the staff
[8685.44s -> 8689.92s]  comments. Have I got any discussion on that point? I was happy with the staff comment.
[8691.76s -> 8697.52s]  Yeah, absolutely. Excellent. How about anybody else adding anything to that? No, bro.
[8698.56s -> 8706.16s]  Through the chair, just a point to note here, this submitter I believe was one who could not make
[8706.80s -> 8715.36s]  the hearings either yesterday or today, because quite fortunate personally managed to find
[8715.36s -> 8720.96s]  himself a new job admittedly in another part of the country, but the well done him for that.
[8721.60s -> 8726.64s]  So he wasn't able to present in person. Okay.
[8727.60s -> 8735.20s]  Well, Mike, I'm just thinking, Roger myself, we should probably excuse ourselves from this.
[8735.92s -> 8739.68s]  Also, because that came from his museum, which obviously we both trust these off,
[8739.68s -> 8745.12s]  in tune of trying to raise it money, we should declare that we'll take a no part in this decision.
[8746.16s -> 8750.40s]  Okay, that's noted. I think Jenny is it? Yep, that is noted.
[8750.72s -> 8758.32s]  Excellent. It's like. Thanks, Jason. Thank you. So that brings to end the conclusion that
[8758.32s -> 8765.20s]  bad section on budgets. Jenny did you have a Jenny and Senator, do you have a little
[8766.40s -> 8769.20s]  table for us to produce? But before we sign off on that, let's.
[8769.92s -> 8778.88s]  Well, just if we can get it shared on the screen, so I'm just having a few
[8779.60s -> 8784.00s]  technical issues. It's awesome. There's too much of that. No, Jeremy.
[8784.00s -> 8789.04s]  No, whether you want it, we're going to have a break at this point and I'll carry on or
[8790.88s -> 8796.56s]  and well, I'll be lead by the committee. I'm I'm non-plastic on either option with the way
[8796.56s -> 8805.52s]  soldier on or whether we take a break. I just want to add a copy into about the last
[8805.52s -> 8812.40s]  31.1 submission point and it's just a round. I'm just a response maybe about the Brian
[8812.40s -> 8818.48s]  Perry Charitable Contribution of 300K and maybe just a reflection that it brings
[8819.12s -> 8822.80s]  over that whole week and we'll bring a whole lot of money into the community. So
[8823.68s -> 8829.44s]  in other things like that too. Okay, thanks. So did a pot of what did you want us to
[8829.44s -> 8836.00s]  potentially look at and changing anything or making a decision to that staff comment? Or are you
[8836.00s -> 8844.64s]  just playing it for us to be aware of? No, I don't think there's any harm in adding that a little bit
[8844.64s -> 8852.24s]  of comment in the bottom that what we provide to Brian Perry Charitable Trust brings in a lot of
[8852.48s -> 8858.08s]  revenue over that whole week so and it's fully justified what we at lay on that on the other
[8858.08s -> 8863.92s]  bit. Okay, thank you. Thanks, Porto. We're comfortable with making an amendment
[8863.92s -> 8866.88s]  prepped or an addition rather to that staff comment in that vein.
[8870.56s -> 8880.96s]  Yep, I see nodding a bit a few nods of heads. Sorry, no, it was 31.1. The last
[8881.28s -> 8888.40s]  measure we dealt with. So I can't see potile such as relying on trying to get my
[8888.40s -> 8895.68s]  tension in other words. So we must do it before we should have. So I take it where we
[8895.68s -> 8901.76s]  comfortable with making an addition there and refer. Yeah, okay, so I've generally
[8901.76s -> 8905.36s]  couldn't cooperate that there'd be much appreciated. Right, right.
[8905.68s -> 8912.40s]  No, did we want to break just for five minutes or something so Jenny can get that?
[8912.40s -> 8918.08s]  Oh, no, here we go. She's got your screen up. Look at you, go. Okay.
[8922.72s -> 8930.16s]  So in terms of the budgets, summarizing at 10.6, no change. I've got that 10.7.
[8930.16s -> 8934.88s]  There is a slight amendment to the comments. A mean staff comment to reflect the fact that
[8934.88s -> 8942.48s]  this is not a lot of counsel. Thank you. They're next three round changed. 12.5.
[8946.24s -> 8950.64s]  I think it was 12.2, where I think was that, oh no, 12.5.
[8952.64s -> 8959.12s]  Yeah, it's a deferral. Yeah, that's the deferring any non-essential
[8959.52s -> 8965.04s]  expenditure at like museums and polls. The council acknowledged the submission and endorsed
[8965.04s -> 8966.96s]  the staff comments. I've got a techniques to that one.
[8970.16s -> 8975.12s]  For you, Madam Chair, I also had that unchanged and just supporting the
[8975.12s -> 8982.16s]  count of recommendation. Yeah, okay, excellent. So the only thing was the 12.4.
[8982.16s -> 8988.40s]  We just had a funny little. We're going to make a clarification on that training component.
[8990.08s -> 8999.04s]  I guess I'd have to take on 12.4, but that we would, we would just include
[8999.04s -> 9005.60s]  our extra information in response to the submitter. Yeah, brilliant. So rolling on the
[9005.60s -> 9016.56s]  2019.1 unchanged, as is 21.5, 22.1, 22.4, 22.5, 22.6, and I think they went right at the end
[9017.28s -> 9020.88s]  set for their comment on the final one. That's right, which have put on their
[9020.88s -> 9024.72s]  thank you very much, including a comment about the Brown period trust. Bringing
[9025.76s -> 9030.40s]  things to the district. Excellent. I think that's something that is
[9030.40s -> 9037.28s]  reflects our discussion. What was that? Now, did we, as now, have passed a
[9037.28s -> 9042.32s]  lever? Did we want to push on into the next category, or did we want to take an
[9042.32s -> 9046.16s]  early lunch break, and then tally in your hands, people?
[9048.08s -> 9055.60s]  Oh, push on. Okay. I mean, lunchtons at 12. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, well, the
[9055.60s -> 9059.44s]  chronologically, the next one's community funding. So let's
[9059.44s -> 9062.64s]  refer to it. The first cab off the rank there is the St Andrews
[9062.64s -> 9066.88s]  Presbyterian Church, and Tio Motio. Obviously, Mr Miller submitted to
[9066.88s -> 9072.00s]  us today in Herson, and I assume this will be one that we'll
[9072.00s -> 9076.64s]  defer the decision on until the 9th of June, but we need the list. We'll have a
[9076.64s -> 9081.36s]  discussion today. Something like to kick me off.
[9085.36s -> 9091.52s]  In terms of this proposal, obviously, it's huge, and I would suspect even if
[9091.52s -> 9097.92s]  the Council approved the million dollars unfortunately for this project. I
[9097.92s -> 9102.40s]  don't know whether the other funding would be forthcoming if they've only
[9102.40s -> 9106.80s]  got 800,000 sitting there at the moment. But the question I had and
[9106.80s -> 9113.12s]  probably from the finance team is, is there some other way, if we
[9113.12s -> 9118.72s]  think that it is, and I think it is a worthwhile project, whether we could
[9118.72s -> 9122.96s]  guarantee a loan fragment sake of the of the million dollars and
[9122.96s -> 9128.88s]  and what would the costs with our interest rates, what over a 30 year period,
[9128.88s -> 9134.72s]  what are the repayments likely to be, and that would give them some
[9134.72s -> 9139.76s]  I suppose strength in going to the other funding agencies, knowing that
[9139.76s -> 9146.08s]  that there was that bone capability there that they would need to pay back,
[9146.08s -> 9151.60s]  but at least they would be able to get their facility built, and I certainly
[9151.60s -> 9156.16s]  think it will get a lot of use, so maybe repaying a loan might not be such a
[9156.16s -> 9162.16s]  bad option for them, at least it gives them some guarantee, but I suspect that
[9162.16s -> 9166.32s]  the other community fundraising is going to be a real tool ask in this
[9166.32s -> 9172.32s]  climate.
[9172.32s -> 9174.32s]  Do you have a comment there?
[9174.32s -> 9182.32s]  No, no. Hazel. Well, well, yes, I think in the overall presentation of the
[9182.32s -> 9190.56s]  people that have put in for community funding is going back to, now the time is
[9190.56s -> 9198.96s]  right for a review of how all of our community groups function. I'm aware of groups
[9198.96s -> 9206.80s]  that pop up when there's actually, they should have actually associated themselves with
[9206.80s -> 9215.76s]  something that's already working, and I think that this leads me off to Debbie's
[9216.24s -> 9224.96s]  need for community workers, but I think if we can actually put together a discussion,
[9224.96s -> 9231.92s]  we can get all these groups functioning together, and then hand out funding, because it
[9231.92s -> 9237.68s]  sounds to me like Saint Andrew's Presbyterian, the T.I.M. as you plan, could actually
[9237.68s -> 9243.60s]  provide a home for something like this to happen. Oh, sorry about that. I thought the
[9243.60s -> 9253.12s]  phone was switched off. And you know, I've been looking at this for quite some time about
[9253.84s -> 9261.12s]  how we can actually have a connection and a concerted effort to bring our socio-economic
[9261.12s -> 9268.00s]  problems within the community together so that we can present them in a sensible way and make
[9268.00s -> 9276.00s]  headway, because when you've got the each little group doing its thing, it doesn't work.
[9276.00s -> 9282.40s]  I think I'm supporting this. I'm supporting, you know, I think there's got to be merit in this,
[9282.40s -> 9289.60s]  but I like what Jim has said. Anyway, that's just my overall comment that's going to apply to all
[9289.60s -> 9296.32s]  of this. Okay, thank you for your comments, Hazel. I think at first glance, this is obviously
[9296.32s -> 9300.88s]  a quiz for a million dollars towards their project, and that's probably where we should focus
[9300.88s -> 9306.48s]  out a discussion at this point. You'll point to a well-made, then needs to be cooperation,
[9306.48s -> 9310.72s]  that's supposed to be effective for sure. But do we have somebody else who hasn't been
[9310.72s -> 9316.72s]  clear or are you just clear? Yeah, yeah, so I think it's a really worthwhile project. I mean,
[9317.52s -> 9323.76s]  I was worried about the requests for a million dollar grant at this time. I think we've all
[9323.76s -> 9329.84s]  got to be realistic, but on the other hand, yeah, the proposal makes a lot of sense, and I think
[9329.84s -> 9335.84s]  if there was a way to support it, then yeah, I'd be in favour of it. I mean, obviously, I am really
[9335.84s -> 9344.40s]  focused on keeping rates, rises, yeah, within a second. Yeah, it really does depend on the final
[9344.40s -> 9352.08s]  look of the annual plan, but I think, you know, six and a lot of boxes for a meeting a lot of needs
[9352.08s -> 9356.08s]  in that's in a really good position, and I think they've got a good track record of
[9356.96s -> 9362.96s]  quite extensive community group involvement in the stuff they will redo and stuff like that,
[9362.96s -> 9369.12s]  but yeah, but with that provider that, yeah, it's not really the best time of our cycle to be
[9369.12s -> 9378.56s]  asked for money. I had had a bit of feedback from funders, because I had participated in some funding
[9378.56s -> 9383.68s]  with an answer in the last few weeks, and what I have seen is actually trust the Waikato,
[9384.24s -> 9391.28s]  do you feel they will be able to meet the usual funding or requirements? But locked
[9391.28s -> 9398.08s]  lot of reasons signal that they may well be reduced, yeah, so that, yeah, I don't know that's helpful.
[9398.08s -> 9401.12s]  Okay, thank you, Claire, Andrew, you had your hand up, and then lower, I think.
[9401.12s -> 9404.00s]  Yeah, thank you. Thanks, Susan.
[9404.64s -> 9413.92s]  Look, I think we all think the project's probably got mirrors, but to put another million dollars
[9413.92s -> 9420.80s]  into an annual plan is just not what council can do. I just don't see, we certainly can't
[9420.80s -> 9427.76s]  make a grant of a million dollars, it's just not. I mean, that's a kind of some that has to go
[9427.76s -> 9437.44s]  into a lot to plan and be considered in that way. If there is some way of constructing a line
[9438.16s -> 9445.52s]  possibly, we could look at it, but really, I can't support this as it stands.
[9446.56s -> 9448.56s]  Quickly, low and then keen, I've keenly.
[9448.56s -> 9452.32s]  All right, I want that very long. Thank you for your chair, Madam Chair.
[9452.32s -> 9457.12s]  It's just simply the fact that if we borrow or they have a loan, they won't have the equity,
[9457.20s -> 9461.36s]  because I'm to actually borrow any further. So it'll make it very difficult for them to actually
[9461.36s -> 9467.68s]  fund race, Susan. It's quite difficult, and you have not a large amount of equity in a project,
[9467.68s -> 9473.04s]  but it has great merit to the kind of, it's just great merit to the child.
[9473.04s -> 9479.52s]  And I think it could be utilized through, I wonder a little bit as Mayor Jim said earlier,
[9479.52s -> 9485.12s]  whether they would have the ability to race the existing or lift race to the mound.
[9485.52s -> 9492.48s]  In the Victorian climate, economic climate, and as I said, I agree with Andrew, I can't see
[9492.48s -> 9497.68s]  us having that some to give them that equity that they would need to further buy it.
[9497.68s -> 9501.52s]  Thank you, Lou. Ken, did you have some comments today?
[9501.52s -> 9507.76s]  Yes, so it looks just picking up on his, on his worship, some comment in terms of could we
[9507.76s -> 9514.32s]  could we guarantee a loan? So, yes, we certainly do have a community organisation
[9514.32s -> 9522.32s]  named in sporting organisation loan guarantee policy. So, there are criteria around that.
[9522.32s -> 9527.68s]  In each I think that there might be, there might be an upper level, keep as well, and in a
[9527.68s -> 9531.92s]  million dollars would probably be really pushing the boundaries, and regard to that.
[9531.92s -> 9537.12s]  Judge Justin, you know, I'd have to jump on to Citrix to actually locate that, and policy
[9537.12s -> 9541.60s]  I don't, don't have it on hand, but yeah, but certainly if they qualified under there
[9542.00s -> 9547.28s]  under their policy, that's what that's about, and it certainly helps an organisation there,
[9547.28s -> 9552.72s]  and that preps doesn't have, doesn't have good equity or assets to secure against,
[9552.72s -> 9558.64s]  because of course, they're falling back, although the bank security is obviously the council
[9558.64s -> 9564.40s]  the council guarantee. So, yeah, so it's we've done that for multiple community organisations over
[9564.40s -> 9569.20s]  many years, and yeah, like say if they fit those criteria and we'll preps some
[9569.20s -> 9574.16s]  comeback with what those criteria are, and we could probably do that. Yes, that's it's only after
[9574.16s -> 9578.88s]  after lunch today, and yeah, we could send me some consider considering it.
[9580.72s -> 9588.24s]  Yeah, so sorry Roger, just, just the, the reason I asked that was, and obviously,
[9588.24s -> 9594.32s]  MIT's the biggest one I've ever known council guarantee, which was for that million dollars.
[9594.96s -> 9604.64s]  So, so the possibility is there, but on with Andrew, if it was coming down today to make a decision
[9604.64s -> 9610.56s]  from million dollars grant, and that was going on the rates is no way that I think the council
[9610.56s -> 9617.68s]  could even contemplate that in the current climate, but providing an opportunity for them to go
[9617.68s -> 9624.56s]  out with some more surety to other funders. That was the only reason I suggested a loan or
[9624.56s -> 9631.52s]  guarantee proposition might be the way round it for them. Yeah, yeah, thinking literally, Roger,
[9631.52s -> 9642.00s]  did you have comments? Yep, can you? Yeah, yes, I certainly support their gems comments there.
[9642.08s -> 9652.08s]  I think it sounds like a tremendous project for TA, but similarly, I don't think we could consider
[9652.08s -> 9660.56s]  a million dollar grant on rates, but if there was a way in which we could guarantee the loan
[9660.56s -> 9666.32s]  and enable them to go on to the next stage, I mean, it would also be dependent upon other agencies
[9666.40s -> 9671.84s]  coming in and supporting them. So, even if we guaranteed the law, there's no surety,
[9671.84s -> 9676.96s]  but in fact, it would go on to that next stage. But I think it's something that would be worthwhile
[9676.96s -> 9682.48s]  investigating, because obviously it would be a tremendous facility for the town.
[9683.60s -> 9689.60s]  So, yeah, against grant, but certainly for looking at opportunities to support that
[9689.60s -> 9700.64s]  organization in a long guarantee. Thank you. Yes. Yeah, thank you, Susan. So, I know that there are
[9700.64s -> 9704.32s]  things for a million dollars, but I'm pretty confident that I'll be pretty confident that
[9704.32s -> 9711.44s]  happily settle on something risk. I'm just wondering if we really ought to consider a smaller grant
[9711.44s -> 9716.64s]  at this point and then encourage them to come back in subsequent years and work through the LCP.
[9717.36s -> 9723.28s]  This is a very organised group. They've done a heck of a lot to date and without some kind of
[9723.28s -> 9728.64s]  council assistance. And I think it would feel like we simply went support of other.
[9731.20s -> 9736.16s]  So, a guaranteeing a loan would be a really good idea, but I still think we can probably
[9736.16s -> 9740.88s]  assist them with some dollars, but to a far less degree than the million dollars that they're
[9740.96s -> 9750.48s]  requesting. Yeah, it's really poor timing for the misnet and not that they had any control over
[9750.48s -> 9756.88s]  that, but certainly a project with huge mirror, there's no two ways about it. But just how
[9756.88s -> 9764.64s]  we can assist in what that means in terms of our financial position as well, that we really have to
[9764.64s -> 9772.08s]  be weighing out, don't we? Yeah, I'm just thinking about the other requests that we're
[9772.08s -> 9776.88s]  going to be dealing with shortly, the Cambridge Community House. So, I don't want to
[9776.88s -> 9784.56s]  blue the two things, but you know, it might be that a $1,000, you know, sort of they're
[9784.56s -> 9790.24s]  going to get to this project. Well, you know, maybe work with us on our, and I know we're looking
[9790.24s -> 9795.28s]  at all the options here. Yeah, understand what you're saying. Clear, you had a comment and then
[9795.28s -> 9800.88s]  Mike. Yeah, I mean, I think Lizard's approach is something that I'd be interested in that
[9800.88s -> 9807.92s]  scoring. I wanted to make the point that I think it's important for us as a council to demonstrate
[9807.92s -> 9813.76s]  support for the project, because they made a point in the submission that the council support
[9813.76s -> 9822.08s]  is needed for the other funders to give to seriously consider it. So, yeah, I'm pretty keen to see
[9822.08s -> 9829.04s]  some way that we can demonstrate some solid support. And someone commented on about the need,
[9829.04s -> 9837.44s]  how well would they fundraise though the other the shortfall from the grants and things? And
[9837.44s -> 9842.64s]  they do mention that they've got some land to sell, and there was no mention that they are sitting
[9843.92s -> 9850.40s]  other loans. I think it was more pledges from Parisians and locals. I think, but yeah,
[9850.40s -> 9856.72s]  it didn't. It wasn't a definitive list, but I think they had got quite a well-paying strategy.
[9857.84s -> 9865.04s]  Yeah, yeah, reflected on the quality of the proposal. Yeah, thanks, clear.
[9866.16s -> 9871.36s]  To have any other comments from anyone? Marks, right, Mike. Yeah, maybe just I guess with
[9871.36s -> 9876.88s]  discussiness now with a recommendation, not through the June. So, I guess my thoughts are just picking
[9876.88s -> 9881.68s]  up on the comments that have been talked about Liz's commenting about a grant of a smaller
[9881.68s -> 9888.24s]  denomination, and we're going to consider one in Cambridge soon. Also, the loan concept that
[9889.52s -> 9894.16s]  Jim's brought up in Andrew supported, and maybe I'm just thinking Ken, your team might be to get
[9894.16s -> 9899.52s]  worth them, because maybe something along with lines of a combination of both of those in terms of
[9900.16s -> 9905.44s]  COVID is going to be around on the impact for quite some time, and I guess a loan, the problem
[9905.44s -> 9910.16s]  of the loan, of course, is you have to start paying it back. But maybe if a grant could be,
[9910.16s -> 9914.88s]  yeah, if by chance we decided to give them a grant of Examine of Dollars, that that grant
[9914.88s -> 9918.56s]  with the finance team working with them could actually pay back their initial capital and
[9918.56s -> 9922.64s]  interest for the first year or something to sort of good and a little bit of breathing space to get
[9922.64s -> 9929.12s]  going. So, I definitely see some concepts where we can help these people. I mean, the community
[9929.12s -> 9933.84s]  house in Cambridge, we can see that good at does because it's sort of a one-stop shop and the fingers
[9933.84s -> 9939.20s]  go out, and you can definitely see for T.R. Motu that this would come the same sort of thing
[9939.20s -> 9944.40s]  potentially. So, yeah, look, I think everything's been talked about this, some good initiatives here,
[9944.40s -> 9950.32s]  and I'm sure something can be put together for these folks. Yeah, well, well, put Michael, I'm totally
[9950.48s -> 9953.68s]  agree with you. Andrew, were you waving your hands around or you're just clicking a pin?
[9954.72s -> 9962.96s]  Yeah, absolutely. I don't see this as being a manager with the Cambridge community house,
[9962.96s -> 9970.88s]  particularly. I mean, basically, this is a church, and you sort of think that would have a
[9970.88s -> 9976.72s]  you know, that community minded and would have a good impact on T.R. Motu, but I mean,
[9977.68s -> 9981.68s]  I would love to have something like a Cambridge community house in T.R. Motu,
[9982.72s -> 9989.36s]  not something that's attached to a church, and the buildings not designed with that,
[9990.40s -> 9997.52s]  when I looked at the floor plan, at the building plan, there's a hub and there's a, you know,
[9997.52s -> 10003.44s]  just a net and whatever, but it's not a dedicated space to administer to the community.
[10003.44s -> 10014.88s]  Yeah, I, you know, I applaud them, and I think they do good work, but yeah, I, you know, I'd be happy
[10014.88s -> 10024.96s]  to explore ways to help them, but I don't see it really as being part of council, particularly.
[10025.60s -> 10037.52s]  Hey, so, well, Andrew, I, I don't agree, because, but they have invited me to go down and discuss
[10037.52s -> 10045.84s]  with them because we need, we need a better community social services house than we've got at the
[10045.84s -> 10053.20s]  moment, which is nothing. We've got our health and welfare group. We haven't got a place where we can
[10053.20s -> 10058.48s]  actually progress. The fact that it's a church is a great place to be. That's got nothing,
[10058.48s -> 10064.64s]  the fact that it's a church building's got nothing to do with what we need to do there. And,
[10064.64s -> 10073.04s]  and I think that, you know, so I, I applaud to go and have a chat to them because we've been
[10073.04s -> 10077.60s]  longing for this for a long time, and the fact that, you know, and Cambridge is up and running
[10077.60s -> 10086.32s]  so magnificently, while we have been skating around looking for a home to be, and I think the
[10086.32s -> 10092.64s]  church will embrace it because it covers all the principles of Christianity. So, and it's not,
[10092.64s -> 10098.16s]  we're not talking about Christianity. Here we're talking about a commodity that we can use to
[10098.16s -> 10104.96s]  to join together all the services into our community and make some kind of a difference and that
[10104.96s -> 10112.80s]  we're one voice that we can actually get changed to happen. I'm just going to answer to that,
[10112.80s -> 10118.64s]  has I, that's not the concept that I had understood it was to be. It's a community, it's a community
[10118.64s -> 10126.48s]  complex with the ability for performing arts and meeting rooms that might be able to be used by
[10126.48s -> 10132.56s]  community groups, but it's not really a community social services hub, or have I got that wrong?
[10132.64s -> 10138.56s]  No, you haven't, no, you haven't because they hadn't even considered the option that I discussed
[10138.56s -> 10147.12s]  with them. So, you know, I just, I like Jim's idea, you know, liking everybody's idea that we
[10147.12s -> 10152.48s]  actually help them get ahead, but I'm going to go and have a wee chat to them, and it might
[10152.48s -> 10158.32s]  well be that that's not going to be it, but I'd like to think that something we could at
[10158.32s -> 10165.44s]  long last be looking at something someplace where we can actually function. Clear and then Jim.
[10167.92s -> 10173.52s]  Yeah, in the detail of the proposal, they see they differently are aiming to provide social
[10173.52s -> 10178.32s]  services, they see they talk to what the need was, we were people, active in the community and
[10178.32s -> 10183.68s]  what was needed, and so they're specifically provided counselling rooms of a particular size
[10183.68s -> 10187.68s]  and also a pharma room, and things like that, and I think that's why they've got that
[10187.68s -> 10192.56s]  hub next to the kitchen and things like that. So, I think it's in their plan, differently,
[10192.56s -> 10198.56s]  hazel. I'm hearing what people are saying, obviously. Yeah, I just think there was some
[10198.56s -> 10205.20s]  way that we could have system through a loan or as Mike has said, you know, helping them out
[10205.20s -> 10209.28s]  the small ramp and the same way that there's here. I mean, I'd be able to that always
[10209.28s -> 10215.68s]  conscious of the overall rate rises that we're going to be imposing. That's a clear gem.
[10216.96s -> 10221.68s]  Sure you, Susan, as clear did have a rough point that I was going to make, there are
[10221.68s -> 10230.16s]  dedicated counselling rooms in the plans that I saw anyway originally. So, I suppose my idea of
[10230.16s -> 10237.60s]  the loan was that if we have got a facility and look at its way greater than the Cambridge
[10237.60s -> 10245.04s]  Community House, but people using that facility should be prepared to pay a rental for that
[10245.04s -> 10251.20s]  space, whether it be dance lessons or counselling services. So, there should be a business plan,
[10251.84s -> 10256.64s]  because this is being built on private land. It's not going to be counsellor counselling, although
[10256.64s -> 10262.40s]  it's church land, that they should be able to come up with a business plan that actually shows
[10262.40s -> 10270.24s]  what revenue that they are planning to make on an annual basis from leasing out those spaces.
[10270.24s -> 10275.92s]  And then the various counselling groups or the dance groups or weddings or whatever else is held
[10275.92s -> 10284.08s]  there should be paying towards those costs and that can go to paying down a loan. But I can't
[10284.08s -> 10290.88s]  support just a grant on in the circumstances that we're in at the present time. But if there was a
[10290.88s -> 10296.72s]  good business case, then I fully support it. Yeah, thanks for coming. It's Jim Mike.
[10298.80s -> 10305.28s]  Yeah, just to I guess, yeah, I guess not totally agree with what Jim said, but the concept of,
[10305.28s -> 10309.20s]  I guess when you start up a new business, the problem is that, you know, that first year,
[10309.20s -> 10314.00s]  you often need some support. So, I totally agree with the business plan that Jim's talking about.
[10314.00s -> 10318.16s]  And that's why I think King could work with the team and bring us back some more information.
[10318.16s -> 10323.60s]  Hazel work with them too and whoever else needs to exact what this complex can offer the
[10323.60s -> 10329.04s]  community of T.R. movie when it surrounds. And being that grant, and we could consider a
[10329.04s -> 10336.88s]  figure then that could cover up maybe the interest and the principle on any loan that we decided
[10336.88s -> 10340.48s]  to give them, whatever the amount that that would be. And then they could factor that in,
[10340.48s -> 10345.12s]  it buys them a bit of time as it's as I think clear stated, it doesn't say in your
[10345.12s -> 10349.60s]  rest if they're actually going to reply for loans or anything. And I sort of think it was, um,
[10350.64s -> 10357.04s]  low stated. Um, see, I think it's these impossibilities here without costing the rate payer
[10357.04s -> 10366.40s]  much more than I totally put up with. Yeah, yeah, I guess so, so through the cheer and response to,
[10366.40s -> 10372.56s]  um, you know, to Mike. Um, yeah, looks certainly our community, um, low in some loan guarantee
[10372.56s -> 10378.16s]  policy, um, you know, requires the, you know, requires the outside entity that community organization.
[10378.16s -> 10382.72s]  In this case, the church, um, to demonstrate that they're able to sue this, um, yet you know,
[10382.72s -> 10390.16s]  the borrowing, so that they require. Um, and clearly, I mean, is, is, um, is Mike Mike did say,
[10390.16s -> 10394.32s]  um, yeah, this would be quite a different scenario for the young for the church. Um, they've
[10394.32s -> 10398.96s]  asked for a million dollar grant. Um, obviously, if, um, yeah, obviously, there comes a no cost to them.
[10399.04s -> 10403.60s]  Uh, if it's a loan that does come at considerable, um, super sink costs. So, um, yeah, so, look,
[10403.60s -> 10408.64s]  look, they would have to convince us of the ability and to sue us. Um, you know,
[10408.64s -> 10412.24s]  I guess what they would look like is, you know, you know, we'd be happy to have some conversations
[10412.24s -> 10416.40s]  with them, you know, you know, look at that look at the cage flows. We'd have to do that anyway.
[10416.40s -> 10420.08s]  Um, so yeah, and now we could sit soon. We do that. I just don't know, whatever sources
[10420.08s -> 10424.56s]  when come, um, you know, obviously they've got in terms of the ability to sue this, to sue this
[10424.88s -> 10434.56s]  line. Roger, the ingrain. Yeah, thank you through you, Madam Chair. Can any idea of what the cost
[10434.56s -> 10441.12s]  of the interest on a million dollar loan would be approximately to the organization?
[10442.40s -> 10446.32s]  To them. Um, yeah. So, so, look at shall I'm not sure if, um,
[10446.32s -> 10448.72s]  do I, uh, do, do, do, do, do, do, I think you asked all the, I know,
[10448.72s -> 10457.20s]  debrided sort of indicate their, um, well, actually, just translating your figures because I have no idea,
[10457.20s -> 10462.48s]  um, what sort of interest rate of ink would require? Um, interest rates are obviously quite low
[10462.48s -> 10467.12s]  at the moment. Um, yet, you know, maybe if it was, uh, maybe if it was four and a half per cent,
[10467.12s -> 10471.36s]  I don't know if they had some, yet, yet, yet, you know, bet backed up by accounts of guarantee.
[10471.36s -> 10475.36s]  Um, yet, you know, I just looking at your figures here, Deepra, there could be something like
[10475.36s -> 10481.44s]  $100 or $50,000 a year to, um, to sue us a million dollars at a four and a half per cent.
[10482.00s -> 10485.12s]  Um, but I'm not sure if you've, you've got any further further coming there.
[10485.12s -> 10490.00s]  Good, because this is on the basis that there'd be paying an interest rate offered by, but by the
[10490.00s -> 10494.16s]  ink. Um, give me one moment please.
[10497.52s -> 10501.76s]  Be somewhere around 62,000 for interest and repayments.
[10502.64s -> 10509.60s]  All right, 62,000? Yeah, four, four, one million at something like four and a half per cent.
[10509.60s -> 10513.68s]  Yes, okay, interest and repayment. Okay. On a 30 year loan.
[10515.52s -> 10520.56s]  Right, okay, but, yeah, but, but, but look, there's some, there's some really crude assumptions here,
[10520.56s -> 10524.88s]  because I like to say, I have no, no idea. Um, but, you know, what interest rate have been
[10524.88s -> 10530.48s]  for charge or with that big prepared, um, two, um, yeah, two, um, to have that borrowing over over
[10530.48s -> 10535.12s]  30 years. Yeah, yeah, you know, this, this would require the two-year term talking to the,
[10535.12s -> 10538.00s]  talking to their bank and determining determining that.
[10541.68s -> 10546.40s]  Susan, thank you. I just wanted all the talk. We've got a fortnight before we get to the
[10546.40s -> 10550.96s]  night of June. Is it possible to go back to them to see if they've got a business case with some
[10551.04s -> 10554.00s]  actual figures, what they're thinking is, see what they can see, what they can see with some
[10554.00s -> 10558.96s]  cancers, because I think things are damn tight. I mean, it's just, err, the question to give them
[10558.96s -> 10565.36s]  a million dollars. It's just right pay as it canus. Yeah, no, it's good point. I'd like to
[10565.36s -> 10573.36s]  also see if the, the loan concept is of interest of it made of it. And if it's not, then it makes
[10573.36s -> 10578.72s]  our decision quite simple. Okay, are we comfortable with that course of action again? We undertake
[10578.72s -> 10584.56s]  that course of action for you, Steve? Good, we. Now, I'm just, you're aware of the amount of work
[10584.56s -> 10589.84s]  that's been done to collate the financials to be able to, um, appear, address, revise, drag
[10589.84s -> 10597.28s]  gain your pain to prevent the MP on the, um, night of June. So we actually are working to have that,
[10597.28s -> 10603.84s]  um, document and report, completed by the end of this week. So we are requiring some guidance from
[10604.48s -> 10611.44s]  you, and it may be that, yeah, as we see it, there is a level of discomfort, or you're not,
[10611.44s -> 10617.52s]  and a position to make a decision within the context of this meeting, um, that we look at,
[10618.56s -> 10623.68s]  what further information we can make available, um, to relate to members to ensure that you
[10623.68s -> 10629.28s]  provide care able to provide staff with some guidance and direction. And maybe that we take a break
[10629.28s -> 10639.04s]  and, um, and have, um, at a touch point with you, um, outside of this forum. Yeah, okay, I think
[10639.04s -> 10645.84s]  are we happy with that? I think that's probably sensible. Um, I think it's not good. I mean,
[10645.84s -> 10650.64s]  there's, I think we have to help them some way, but how that looks and what that means is quite
[10650.64s -> 10656.24s]  a different, um, is, is how, you know, how are we going to land on a, on a solution that is
[10656.24s -> 10663.44s]  palatable? Um, so I think that would be helpful. Um, I understand that sand can create a breakout
[10663.44s -> 10671.36s]  room, which sounds terribly exciting. And, and, and so, do you propose that we, a June for a short
[10671.36s -> 10678.64s]  time and, and, and I catch up with, with you, um, Christine's staff, or what, what, what's that,
[10678.64s -> 10685.36s]  what does that look like? Everybody needs a break. Right. Yeah, Susan, I, I suppose just in, on
[10685.36s -> 10692.56s]  Christy's Cummings, um, and I can understand their concern that we're going to change the numbers
[10692.56s -> 10698.08s]  and have a whole lot of recalculations and things that are, that are being planned, but at the moment
[10698.08s -> 10703.36s]  we're talking about, well, I was anyway, in terms of the line that wasn't costing us anything,
[10703.36s -> 10710.72s]  and we weren't going to have to vary our, our, our annual plan. I should say, uh, if we give a grant,
[10710.80s -> 10716.40s]  then obviously that will change the numbers. But, um, so, because it was question to you, really,
[10716.40s -> 10722.96s]  as, um, as you're a quiz that if we are contemplating a ground of any size that we should indicate
[10722.96s -> 10726.88s]  how big that is now, so you can look at the numbers.
[10728.72s -> 10730.00s]  Christy, you have to unmute.
[10732.80s -> 10738.16s]  Apology, through you, Madam Chair, yes, um, Mirjam, we would be needing some guide, or speaking
[10738.16s -> 10744.32s]  from Guina, commonly did members as to a quantum and also a potential funding source, either
[10744.32s -> 10750.08s]  you were looking at, um, having council staff utilised, for example, an arbitrage fund, or
[10750.08s -> 10754.16s]  rate funding, we would, we would be seeking some guidance from you in that respect.
[10755.36s -> 10756.16s]  Mmm.
[10756.16s -> 10757.36s]  Mmm.
[10758.16s -> 10763.44s]  So, so, so, so, through the chair, I wonder if, um, if an initial starting point and, um,
[10763.44s -> 10768.00s]  amongst the team, we might just have to talk about who's be Scott Capais over here.
[10768.00s -> 10770.40s]  Um, I wonder if we rang Mr Miller.
[10770.40s -> 10776.48s]  I think it was a rate, rate Miller, and just talked to him about, um, about, um, get, you know,
[10776.48s -> 10780.16s]  a loan guarantee, and we for that would work for them at all.
[10780.72s -> 10785.04s]  Um, so, yeah, I mean, that, I guess, you know, that would be a fairly simple conversation in the,
[10785.04s -> 10788.96s]  in the, in the few cents, um, I, I guess, so, yeah, you know, if there is interest here,
[10788.96s -> 10792.56s]  it would then, the youngest would be on him to, um, to have a chat to the bank,
[10792.56s -> 10795.68s]  and in terms of what, you know, what does that look like? Um, but, like, financially,
[10796.00s -> 10800.32s]  um, but I, I should imagine that we could probably, um, at least have that initial conversation,
[10800.32s -> 10801.52s]  um, pretty, pretty quickly.
[10803.28s -> 10809.44s]  Yeah, and through you, man, actually, just quickly keen, and my recollection is that the air, um,
[10809.44s -> 10812.80s]  policy on guarantees is only for 10 years as well.
[10814.48s -> 10817.28s]  Uh, yeah, yes, I, I believe you are, you are, you are, you are,
[10817.28s -> 10822.16s]  so, so I think it is an upper limit in terms of quantum and NVC, you, you, you are,
[10822.16s -> 10828.40s]  I agree to, I don't have a limit of, um, of 10 years. Um, I mean, it is a policy of council
[10828.40s -> 10834.56s]  and in fact, it's not a statutory policy. Um, so, so, so council and student circumstances could
[10834.56s -> 10840.32s]  vary that. Um, so, yeah, so, um, yeah, but the, the, the, the, the natural, um,
[10840.32s -> 10844.16s]  course of, of, they, policy is, as, as 10 years, you are, I agree, Jim.
[10844.72s -> 10854.24s]  Um, um, Susan, I think it was an, in about a quantum, if we were going to give a grant, and like, um,
[10854.64s -> 10861.28s]  making like suggestion, like a starting point might be, you know, a likely figure that would cover
[10861.28s -> 10866.88s]  the first 12 months for an interesting principle, repayments of, of the loan, or something.
[10866.88s -> 10870.56s]  I thought that was a good approach, because I know what it's like when you've got a big project
[10870.56s -> 10874.64s]  and trying to find a little, and if you knew you didn't have to find that for the first year,
[10874.64s -> 10884.00s]  I think it would be quite good to, it is a starting point. So, the first year was 62,000, yeah.
[10884.56s -> 10889.44s]  You will, that was that 4.5 percent. I mean, I did have a look online at what mortgage rates are,
[10889.44s -> 10895.84s]  they're actually below that. So, I'm thinking around 50,000, might, might be in the ballpark.
[10895.92s -> 10902.40s]  Yeah. Yeah. Mike, you had your hand up? I mean, the 10 year thing changes things significantly.
[10903.52s -> 10909.60s]  Um, absolutely significantly. I mean, if a 4.1, 9 percent, you're, you're then looking at $10,000 a month,
[10909.60s -> 10914.48s]  or principle and interest of a 10 year. So, it does, but to me, it seems like there's a whole lot of balls in
[10914.48s -> 10921.04s]  the air here, and how the hell can we make a decision in the next half of this, and I'm sorry,
[10921.12s -> 10926.48s]  stuff, but my point of view is we need to buy some time here, and do some decent due diligence on this,
[10927.84s -> 10931.84s]  and not rush it. You know, there's a whole bunch of ideas here, whether there are some commodities
[10931.84s -> 10936.16s]  formed through part of the Swaliva, but this is not a decision to make between now and lunch
[10936.16s -> 10942.64s]  of just just after it. Okay. Thanks to your comments, Mike Andrew. I couldn't agree with you more
[10942.64s -> 10952.00s]  on that, Mike. You know, this is, this is a significant, I'm, I'm asked that we're being asked for,
[10952.80s -> 10958.16s]  and while I totally agree with some of the things you say, Hazel, and for instance, I would
[10958.16s -> 10963.28s]  like I said before, I'd love to have something like Cambridge Community House operating at Tomi
[10963.28s -> 10968.32s]  do, but we have no idea, at this point, whether this could fulfill that function or not,
[10968.32s -> 10975.92s]  we have to do a lot more, we need a lot more, so I'll leave it. That and Gary's got us here.
[10975.92s -> 10983.84s]  Gary, yeah. If you think about him, Chair, as long as the committee gives the staff a clear
[10983.84s -> 10990.56s]  steer, and essentially what I'd suggest that steer is that staff be directed to work with the
[10990.56s -> 10996.88s]  Church to see how we might be able to assist, but, and so far as the annual planners concerned,
[10996.88s -> 11001.52s]  we're not intending to have any impact on the rate in order to assist this project. Now,
[11001.52s -> 11008.80s]  that still allows us to leave the door open for things like, say, a grant from the arbitrage fund,
[11008.80s -> 11013.92s]  you still have some tools in your character, but, but, critically, what the staff need is,
[11013.92s -> 11019.52s]  this steer and relation to impact on rate. And if we draw the line there, then that I think will
[11019.52s -> 11024.08s]  be a good steer for staff at the moment. Yeah. Oh, good. That seems pretty sense.
[11024.08s -> 11029.44s]  I agree with that. Yeah, Roger. Lots of heads are nodding profusely on my screen, so that that's
[11029.44s -> 11035.52s]  positive. Okay, so can I take it that we're happy with that course of action, and that is pretty
[11035.52s -> 11042.96s]  much reflected before that the recommendations there are appropriate and the circumstances,
[11042.96s -> 11047.52s]  that the council considers us request within the budget of the constraints of the annual paying
[11047.52s -> 11052.56s]  as Gary just indicated, and that we acknowledge the submission. In the background, of course,
[11052.56s -> 11060.16s]  we direct staff to assist with the church, in terms of, in terms of trying to help them get
[11060.16s -> 11064.56s]  getting a thing off the ground in, then I think that's probably the best we can do right now.
[11065.76s -> 11070.88s]  Exactly. And I think that, and I'd like with us to come with me, that we actually go and
[11070.96s -> 11081.04s]  develop the concept of the wider use that that we propose to have centralized there.
[11081.76s -> 11085.76s]  If that's the case, and then we'd also really have to talk to the, a little bit to the health
[11085.76s -> 11092.40s]  and welfare committee as well. Currently, we sit at Klinga Aroha with our knees up under our
[11092.40s -> 11103.76s]  chin in a very small room. So, I agree. I agree with Andrew, it's a shame that it's, we need a
[11103.76s -> 11110.08s]  quick decision here, and I agree with the things that you're saying Andrew, but I'm going to go for
[11110.08s -> 11117.28s]  that, and it might not, it won't be tomorrow, but it's, you know, this, it'll take a little bit of
[11117.28s -> 11122.32s]  time now to put that whole business plan together, and allow them to see that the community,
[11122.64s -> 11129.52s]  is behind them. Thanks Hazel. So, we're happy with that. When do we want to move on with the next
[11129.52s -> 11134.72s]  community funding, or at a CITS team pass 12, do we want to have a break for lunch and come back
[11134.72s -> 11140.72s]  with renewed vigor for the, the remaining education under that community funding section, or do you
[11140.72s -> 11147.04s]  want to address the Cambridge? You want to have a break? Yeah, so this is a portal.
[11147.04s -> 11154.64s]  I just want to allow us to comment about the combined sort of social services based at
[11154.64s -> 11160.00s]  the Cent Andrews proposed building. I think the beauty of the Cambridge community
[11161.60s -> 11165.76s]  shared services, or social services, is that it is a completely neutral,
[11167.36s -> 11172.64s]  and it's run by a community service, it's not run by a church, it's such the churches come together
[11172.64s -> 11179.44s]  to support their co-puppa from an e-week perspective, going to a church all the time.
[11180.48s -> 11185.04s]  It does have some connotations on it, and so there's just that one to bear in mind Hazel,
[11185.04s -> 11191.36s]  but perhaps you may include some of the, you know, we talk to a way, come in with a net
[11191.36s -> 11198.96s]  discussion as well, to get their perspective on it. Yeah, so I had no doubt, because I, you can take
[11198.96s -> 11204.72s]  a huge connotation out of this, because it's not the church that we're going to be going into,
[11204.72s -> 11212.48s]  it's the building attached to the church that we're going to. Okay, I think please discuss that
[11212.48s -> 11217.60s]  one fairly thoroughly. Thank you, portal for your comments. Thank you. And I think it's probably
[11217.60s -> 11223.76s]  time we had a bit of a break. It's a team past 12. How about we come back in half now? We
[11223.76s -> 11228.80s]  have you with that or do people want longer? Yep. No, I'll go to the next one.
[11228.80s -> 11238.88s]  Half now it's fine, okay, so that takes us to 1240. Fantastic. Okay. So I think the plan is just
[11238.88s -> 11248.88s]  to, yeah, disconnect your, and your videos, stop videos.
[11268.88s -> 11270.88s]  You
